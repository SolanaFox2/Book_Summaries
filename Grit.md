### Preface

**Preface**
- Author's father frequently expressed concern about their intellectual abilities
- Dad believed none of his children were "geniuses"
- Author herself was told repeatedly she was not a genius

### Chapter 1 Showing Up

**West Point Admissions Process**
- Rigorous process: high school grades, SAT/ACT scores, fitness assessment
- Only 1,200 out of 2,500 cadets are admitted each year
- Most had been varsity athletes and team captains in high school
- One in five dropouts leave during first two months (Beast Barracks)

**Beast Barracks Training Program**
- Intensive seven-week program for new cadets
- Designed to transition from "new cadet to Soldier"
- **Typical Day**: 5:00 a.m. wake-up, 12 hours of training/classes, athletics, and military instruction
- No weekends or breaks, minimal contact with family and friends

**Challenges Faced by Cadets in Beast Barracks**
- Pushed beyond their limits: mentally, physically, militarily, socially
- Weaknesses are identified and addressed to toughen cadets.

#### The Enigma of Cadet Attrition at West Point

**Graduate School Research on Graduation Rates at West Point (2004)**

**Background:**
- Jerry Kagan's research in 1955: unsuccessful attempts to identify reasons for dropping out using stories and tests
- Several generations of psychologists researched the issue but couldn't definitively answer why some cadets quit

**Researcher's Approach (2004):**
- Contacted military psychologist Mike Matthews at West Point for insights
- Discussed the challenges in predicting graduation rates based on Whole Candidate Score
- Noted that high scorers were just as likely to drop out as low scorers

**Mike Matthews' Experience:**
- Admissions process identifies potential military leaders through Whole Candidate Score
- SAT/ACT scores, high school rank, leadership potential assessment, physical fitness evaluation
- Whole Candidate Score is crucial factor in admissions but doesn't reliably predict who will complete Beast (military training)

**Mike Matthews' Clue:**
- Personal experience joining the air force: induction process had similarities to West Point's training

#### Perseverance as a Key Factor in Success

**The Psychology of Success: Perseverance and Persistence**

**Challenges Exceeding Current Skills**:
- Recruits were asked to do things they couldn't yet do
- This led to feelings of tiredness, loneliness, frustration, and the desire to quit
- Those who dropped out rarely did so from lack of ability

**The Importance of a "Never Give Up" Attitude**:
- What mattered was not talent but an unwavering determination to succeed
- This was evident in various fields, from business to art to athletics

**Commonalities Among Highly Accomplished Individuals**:
- They were lucky and talented, but also persistent and persevering
- Many had overcome initial struggles and failures, rather than giving up
- They were constantly driven to improve and never satisfied with their current abilities

**The Power of Perseverance**:
- Highly accomplished individuals were dogged in their pursuits
- They had unrealistic expectations of themselves and remained unsatisfied with their progress
- This contrasted with complacent individuals who assume they are already good enough

#### The Power of Grit: A New Measurement Scale for Determination and Perseverance

**Grit Scale and Its Significance**

**Background:**
- Successful people have enduring determination and passion (grit)
- Two components: perseverance and direction
- Intangible quality, hard to quantify
- Interviews revealed importance of grit in high achievers

**Measuring Grit:**
- Developed the Grit Scale questionnaire
  - Half on perseverance
    * Overcoming setbacks
    * Finishing what's begun
  - Half on passion
    * Consistent interests
    * Obsession with ideas/projects

**West Point Study:**
- July 2004: Grit Scale administered to cadets
- No correlation between Whole Candidate Scores and grit scores
- Surprising finding, as talent and grit assumed interrelated
- Talented individuals not guaranteed endurance or perseverance.

#### The Power of Grit: A Predictor of Success Across Fields

**Grit's Role in Achieving Goals: Evidence from West Point and Other Fields**

**West Point Study**:
- Grit was a reliable predictor of who made it through Beast (military training) and who dropped out
- No differences found between stayers and leavers in Whole Candidate Scores, individual components, SAT scores, high school rank, leadership experience, or athletic ability

**Sales Profession**:
- Grit predicted job retention at a vacation time-share company
- No other personality trait (extroversion, emotional stability, conscientiousness) was as effective in predicting job retention

**High School Graduation**:
- Grittier students were more likely to graduate on schedule
- Grit was a more powerful predictor of graduation than how much students cared about school, how conscientious they were, and how safe they felt at school

**Formal Schooling Degrees**:
- Grittier adults were more likely to earn advanced degrees (MBA, PhD, MD, JD) compared to those with only a four-year college degree or some college credits but no degree
- Adults who successfully earned degrees from two-year colleges scored slightly higher in grit than graduates of four-year colleges

**Green Berets Partnership**:
- The author started a partnership with the Army Special Operations Forces (Green Berets) to study grit's role in goal achievement.

#### "The Importance of Grit in Elite Training and Success"

**Green Berets Training:**
- Elite soldiers assigned to dangerous missions
- Preliminary training includes:
  - Nine weeks of boot camp
  - Four weeks of infantry training
  - Three weeks of airborne school
  - Four weeks of preparation course on land navigation
- Selection Course is the most challenging stage, with a 42% dropout rate
- Focuses on rigorous physical and mental tests:
  - Long hours from dawn to evening
  - Running and marching with heavy loads
  - Obstacle courses, including "Nasty Nick"

**Grit's Role in Success:**
- Predictor of success in military, education, business
- Regardless of other factors like experience or support:
  - Grit is a significant predictor of success
- In diverse domains: sales, Chicago schools, Green Berets training

**Spellbound Documentary:**
- Released during the author's graduate school year
- Follows children preparing for and competing in Scripps National Spelling Bee
- Contestants must outperform thousands of other students to reach finals:
  - Spell increasingly obscure words without errors, round after round
- Author wondered about role of talent vs. grit in spelling bee success

#### Grit Predicts Success in Spelling Bee Competition

**Kimble's Study on Spelling Bee Participants**

**Grit Scale**:
- Sent to all 273 spelling bee finalists
- 2/3 returned questionnaires, representing a range of ages (7-15 years old)
- Practiced over an hour per day on weekdays, over 2 hours per day on weekends
- Wide variation in practice hours

**Verbal Intelligence**:
- Assessed in a subsample of spellers
- Spellers demonstrated unusual verbal ability
- Range of scores from "verbal prodigy" to "average" for their age

**Competition Performance**:
- Grit scale scores predicted better competition performance
- Gritter kids studied more hours and competed in more bees
- Verbal intelligence also predicted performance, but no correlation with grit
- Verbally talented spellers did not study more or compete more than others

**Insight**:
- Potential vs. What we do with it is quite different

### Chapter 2 Distracted by Talent

**The Author's Journey from Consulting to Teaching**

#### The Power of Effort Over Talent in Learning Math

**The Shift from Aptitude to Effort**

**Understanding Student Struggles**:
- Students who were "not math people" struggled despite aptitude
- Hard work and persistence led to academic success
- Conventional wisdom about talent and achievement was challenged

**The Importance of Effort**:
- Aptitude did not guarantee achievement in math class
- Teachers should consider the importance of effort rather than just talent

- Believed that **zeal and hard work** are more important than intellectual ability
- Held that he lacked **quickness of apprehension** and **superior memory**, but had strong observational skills and work ethic

#### "Pursuit of Optimal Potential: Talent vs Effort"

**Darwin's Approach to Natural Science:**
* Nearly equal industry in observation and collection of facts
* Steady and ardent love for natural science
* Kept questioning the same problems longer than others
* Deliberately didn't engage in semi-willful forgetting
* All questions kept alive, ready for relevant data

**William James on Human Potential:**
* Humans use only a small part of their mental and physical resources

* Exceptions exist who push limits to extremes
* Most people live within self-imposed limitations
* Talents vary, but effort is crucial for success
* Americans emphasize effort over talent
* Hard work valued more than intelligence or athletic ability
* Surveys show preference for hardworking employees.

#### The "Naturalness Bias" in Perception of Success and Talent

**Natural vs. Striver Bias:**
- Chia's experiments reveal inconsistency between people's stated beliefs and deep convictions
- Musicians favor "naturals" over "strivings" in terms of success, hireability
  * One pianist described as natural with early talent
  * Other as striver with motivation and perseverance
  - In direct contradiction to their beliefs about effort vs. talent

**Entrepreneurship:**
- Chia's study on business professionals revealed similar bias in entrepreneur domain
- Participants rated "naturals" higher for success, hirability, proposal quality
- People tended to favor natural over striver when choosing between them
  * Favoritism persisted despite disparities in experience and capital

**Hidden Prejudice:**
- Naturalness bias is a hidden preference for those naturally talented
- Disregard for those who've achieved through hard work and effort
- May not admit to this bias, but evident in our choices.

**Chia's Personal Experience:**
- Chia, a professor at University College London, publishes her research in prestigious academic journals.

### Chapter 3 Effort Counts Twice

**The Myth of Talent**

**Talent as an Explanation**:
- Talent is a pervasive lay explanation for athletic success
- It is seen as an "invisible substance" that distinguishes the best athletes
- Athletes are viewed as having a special "gift" or "thing" that others do not possess

**The Mundanity of Excellence**:
- **Superlative performance** is the aggregate of countless individual elements
- Each individual skill or activity is "ordinary", but when done consistently and correctly, produces excellence
- The idea of talent as an explanation for success is a "hard sell"

**Dan Chambliss' Observations**:
- Spent 6 years studying swimmers at all levels, from local to elite
- Talent is the most pervasive lay explanation for athletic success
- Saw talent as an "invisible substance" that distinguishes the best athletes

#### The Myth of Natural Talent in Swimming

**Natural Talent vs. Practice**

**Dan's Observations**:
- Some people are labeled as "naturals" because we can't explain how they achieved such amazing performance
- Biographies of great swimmers reveal many factors that contribute to their success:
  - Parents who were interested in and could afford coaching, travel, and pool access
  - Thousands of hours of practice refining individual elements

**Perception of Natural Talent**:
- It's easy to assume great performance is a "gift" when we don't see the daily training and improvement
- The minimal talent needed to succeed in swimming is lower than most people think
- Anatomical advantages can contribute to success, but they are not trainable

**Incremental Mastery**:
- Greatness is an accretion of many individual feats, each of which is doable
- Even if we don't see the daily training and improvement, it is what leads to excellence

**The Role of Mystery and Magic**:
- We all love mystery and magic in great performances
- The incremental mastery of mundane components may not fully explain everything

#### The Myth and Reality of Natural Talent: A Nietzschean Perspective on Excellence

**The Mythologization of Natural Talent**

**Mark Spitz**:
- Favored to win Olympic gold
- Swimmers were amazed by his performance
- One swimmer said "He's a fish"

**Nietzsche's Perspective**:
- Nietzsche wrote about the same questions
- "With everything perfect, we do not ask how it came to be"
- Prefer the idea of genius as something "magical" rather than earned through effort
- "Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius"
- Allows us to avoid comparing ourselves and finding ourselves lacking

**Reality of Greatness**:
- Nietzsche and Chambliss agreed that great things are accomplished by:
    - People whose thinking is active in one direction
    - Those who employ everything as material
    - Those who perceive models and incentives everywhere
    - Those who take pleasure in making the little, secondary things well rather than just the "dazzling whole"
- Nietzsche emphasized that even "gifted" individuals became "geniuses" through hard work and dedication

**Personal Experience**:
- In graduate school, the author sat down with their advisor, Marty Seligman

#### The Psychology of Achievement: From Talent to Success

**Marty's Challenge: Developing a Theory of Achievement**

**Marty's Advice**:
- You lack a theory for the psychology of achievement
- You have not had a good idea in two years
- Stop reading so much and go think

**Realization**:
- Talent alone does not explain achievement
- Need to understand how talent, effort, skills, and achievement fit together

**Working on a Theory of Achievement**:
- Over 10 years of thinking, diagramming, and collaborating with colleagues
- Published an article presenting two simple equations:
  - **Talent**: How quickly skills improve with investment of effort
  - **Achievement**: Using acquired skills effectively

**Importance of Opportunities**:
- **Opportunities**, such as great coaches or teachers, are crucial to achievement

#### The Psychology of Pottery: Talent and Effort in Achievement

**Theory of Achievement**

**Two Factors in Achievement**:
- Talent: how fast we improve in skill
- Effort: effort builds skill and makes it productive

**Examples**:
- Warren MacKenzie's Pottery:
  - Started as generalists, but focused on ceramics
  - Improved through daily effort and practice
  - Produced more good pots per day over time
  - Skill x Effort = Achievement (number of enduringly beautiful, useful pots)

**Impact of Effort**:
- MacKenzie continues to throw clay every day
- Effort leads to improved skill and increased production
- Talent x Effort = Skill
- Skill x Effort = Achievement

#### Overcoming Dyslexia: John Irving's Journey to Literary Mastery

**John Irving's Writing Journey**

**Background:**

- Father of a dyslexic son led Irving to understand his own struggles
- Accepted he had to work hard and pay attention to detail in writing
- Believed that "you have the capacity for that," even if not natural or easy

**Writing Style:**
- Confident in stamina for revising novels multiple times
- Rewrites are an essential part of his writing process
- Embraces the difficulty, leading to masterful and prolific works

- Refuses to be outworked, even if someone has more talent or abilities

**Background:**
- Grammy Award–winning musician and Oscar-nominated actor
- Participated in Harvard study on healthy young men in 1940

**The Treadmill Test:**
- Designed to measure stamina, strength of will, and aerobic capacity
- Men's performance was a predictor of their psychological adjustment later in life

**Findings:**
- Staying on the treadmill was not just a function of physical fitness but also mental fortitude
- Adjusting for baseline physical fitness had little effect on the correlation between running time and mental health.

#### "The Importance of Perseverance: Life Lessons from George Vaillant"

**Grit and Persistence**

**George's Approach to Life**:
- Refuses to give up easily
- Driven by fascination and persistence
- Examples:
    - Revived the Harvard study
    - Travels extensively to meet participants
    - Continuously working on his research

**Grit vs. Crossword Puzzles**:
- George acknowledges he's not very persistent with crossword puzzles
- But is quick to point out that this doesn't reflect his overall grit and persistence

**The Importance of Showing Up**:
- Woody Allen: "80% of success in life is showing up"
- Quoted by George H.W. Bush and Mario Cuomo
- Implies the importance of following through on commitments

**George's Pole Vaulting Experience**:
- Practiced "chins" (pull-ups) extensively to improve
- Demonstrates his persistence and dedication to practice

#### The Power of Consistent Effort: Grit in Personal Achievement

**Grit and Consistency of Effort:**
* Men's interest in multiple attempts to improve performance on Treadmill Test (staying on vs returning)
* Grit score based on voluntary returns for improvement: reflective of consistency and commitment
* Metaphorical significance of treadmill: long-term progress depends on consistent effort
* Statistics about home exercise equipment usage: 40% quit before expectations met
* Importance of consistency over long run

**Quitting and Giving Up:**
* Many people give up too soon after starting something new
* Long-term benefits outweigh initial talent or natural ability if one works harder and more consistently
* Skill development requires consistent effort to improve and produce results

**Misunderstood Concepts about Talent, Skill, and Effort:**
* Talent is innate; skill is developed through hours of practice
* Talent becomes productive with consistent effort (skill)
* Quitting permanently after encountering obstacles or plateaus hinders progress and productivity.

- Divide by 10 to get total grit score
- Maximum score: 5 (extremely gritty)
- Minimum score: 1 (not at all gritty)

**Interpretation**:
- Score reflects current self-perception of grittiness
- May change over time

**Components of Grit**:
- Passion: Intensity and consistency in commitment to goals
- Perseverance: Ability to stay focused and recover from setbacks

**Grit Scale Analysis**:
- Odd-numbered questions = passion
- Even-numbered questions = perseverance
- High correlation between passion and perseverance, but not identical

**Importance of Consistency**:
- Passion often refers to consistent commitment over time, rather than intensity or obsession.

#### "Passion and Perseverance in Journalism: Jeffrey Gettleman's East Africa Story"

**Passion vs. Enthusiasm: The Difference in Sustained Devotion**

**Mathematicians' Persistence**:
- Mathematicians who work tirelessly on a single problem for years
- Refusing to give up despite the challenge
- This level of sustained focus is rare, not common

**Jeffrey Gettleman: Passion in Action**

- Initially skeptical: "That is the dumbest idea I had heard..."
- Worked as photographer for Cornell Daily Sun instead

**Academic Struggles at Oxford University**
- Lost academically during first year, unclear about future studies
- Professors were surprised by his lack of focus
- Set on pursuing photojournalism initially, inspired by "The Bridges of Madison County" character Robert Kincaid

#### Finding Clarity: Developing a Life Philosophy Through Passion and Goal Hierarchy

**The Importance of Passion as a Compass**

**Passion as a Guide**:
- Takes time to build, tinker with, and get right
- Guides one's "long and winding road" to where they want to be

**Pete Carroll's Philosophy**:
- "Do you have a life philosophy?"
- Not about what specific goals one has, but the broader sense of what they're trying to get out of life

**The Importance of Having a Philosophy**:
- Provides "guidelines and boundaries" to keep one on track
- Allows one to coordinate and purpose their goals

**Goal Hierarchy**:
- Concrete, specific goals (e.g., call business partner) are means to ends
- Higher-level, more abstract goals (e.g., winning championship) are ends in themselves

#### Finding Purpose through Passionate Pursuit

**Goal Hierarchy and Top-Level Goals**

**Three Levels of Goals:**
- Lowest level: specific tasks (e.g., getting out the door by 8 a.m.)
- Mid-level goals: intermediary objectives (e.g., arriving at work on time)
- Highest level: ultimate concern or compass (e.g., being a good leader)

**Ultimate Concern:**
- Top-level goal that gives meaning and direction to lower goals
- Not a means to an end but an end in itself

**Tom Seaver's Example:**
- Career goal: pitch the best he could day after day
- Lower goals: diet, sleep schedule, actions supportive of pitching
- Resulted in a happy and fulfilling life despite its apparent grimness.

**Passion:**
- Deep care for an ultimate concern or compass
- Consistent focus on the same long-term goal
- Organizes significant activities and priorities.

**Grit:**
- Long-term commitment to a top-level goal
- Focused effort toward its achievement.

#### "Unifying Goals for Success and Happiness"

**Understanding Grit:**
- **Grit in gritty people**: Most mid-level and low-level goals are related to an ultimate goal
- **Lack of grit**: Can stem from less coherent goal structures

**Forms of Lack of Grit:**
1. **Positive fantasizing**: Having a top-level goal but no supporting mid-level or low-level goals
   - Short-term payoffs, long-term disappointment
2. Multiple mid-level goals not corresponding to any unifying top-level goal
3. Competing goal hierarchies that aren't connected

**Goal Conflict:**
- Unavoidable in some aspects of life (work vs family)
- Difficulty managing multiple "ultimate concerns"
  - Morally, no right decision only a decision based on personal values

**Importance of Unified Goal Hierarchies:**
- More unified, aligned, and coordinated goal hierarchies lead to better results

**Warren Buffett's Prioritization Technique:**
- Reportedly gave his pilot a simple three-step process for prioritizing goals
  - Buffett urged the pilot to have dreams beyond flying him around.

#### Prioritizing Goals: Warren Buffett's Method and an Additional Step for Focused Passion

**The Buffett Way of Prioritizing Career Goals**

**Step 1: Write down twenty-five career goals**
- Write down all your current career goals
- This can be a challenging exercise, as many people have more than just one goal

**Step 2: Circle the five highest-priority goals**
- Narrow down your list to the most important five goals
- These are the ones you should focus on and avoid distractions from the others

**Step 3: Treat the rest as "avoid at all costs"**
- Recognize that time and energy are limited, so it's essential to decide what not to do

**Challenges in Prioritizing**
- Conventional prioritizing can be insufficient when dealing with multiple high-level career goals
- A successful person needs one internal compass, not several conflicting priorities

**Additional Step: Consider the common purpose of your goals**
- Evaluate how each goal contributes to a single ultimate concern or objective
- This helps focus your passion and maintain consistency in your efforts.

#### Adapting and Improving Through Persistence in Goal-Setting

**Grit and Goal Hierarchy**

**Understanding Grit:**
- Not about stubbornly pursuing every goal at all costs
- Abandoning goals that don't align with higher level objectives

**Roz Chast's Experience:**
- Rejection rate of 90% for established artists like herself
- Early career rejection rates much higher (over 96%) for most cartoonists
- Continued perseverance despite high rejection rates

**Flexibility in Lower Level Goals:**
- Low-level goals are flexible and subject to change
- Revise or replace blocked low-level goals with new ones
- Adapt and overcome setbacks, failures, or dead ends

**Importance of Clear Higher Level Goals:**
- Highest level goals written in ink
- Lower level goals written in pencil for revision or erasure

**Mottos for Perseverance:**
- "Improvise, adapt, overcome" (Green Berets)
- "Try, try again...then try something different."

#### The Intelligence of Great Historical Figures and their Achievements

**Grit and Achievement: The Role of Intelligence vs. Perseverance**

**The Pain of Failures**:
- Real, but not dwelt on for long before moving on

**Mid-Level Goals**:
- Not given up on as easily
- Ultimate aim and life philosophy remain unchanged

**Catharine Cox's Study on High Achievers**:
- Catalogued characteristics of 301 exceptionally accomplished individuals
- Included poets, leaders, scientists, soldiers, philosophers, artists, and musicians
- Published in 1926, based on biographical details and intellectual precocity

**Cox's Findings**:
- Highly intelligent individuals: John Stuart Mill (IQ estimate of 190)
- Less intelligent individuals: Nicolaus Copernicus, Michael Faraday, Miguel de Cervantes
- Isaac Newton ranked in the middle with an IQ of 130

**Intelligence vs. Eminence**:
- Average childhood IQ for the Most Eminent Geniuses (First Ten): 146
- Average IQ for the Least Eminent Geniuses (Last Ten): 143
- Trivial difference in intelligence between the two groups

**Surprising Observation**:
- **Little correlation between intelligence and eminence in Cox's sample**

#### Eminence and Grit: The Link Between Persistence and Success

**Personality Traits of Eminent Individuals**
- Cox evaluated 67 different personality traits in a subset of 100 geniuses
- Most traits showed little difference between eminent and general population (e.g., extroversion, cheerfulness, sense of humor)
- Four indicators that distinguished the First Ten from Last Ten: **persistence of motive**
  - Degree to which they worked with distant objects in view vs. living hand to mouth
  - Active preparation for later life
  - Working toward a definite goal
  - Tendency not to abandon tasks due to changeability or novelty
- Other traits that could be rephrased as **grit** items:
  - Degree of strength of will or perseverance
  - Quiet determination to stick to a course once decided upon
  - Tendency not to abandon tasks in the face of obstacles
  - Perseverance, tenacity, doggedness
- Cox concluded: **high but not highest intelligence combined with greatest degree of persistence will achieve greater eminence**

**Self-Reflection on Grit Scale**
- Understanding your goals and their alignment with a single passion can be progress
- Assessing your ability to persevere in the face of rejection or obstacles is also important.

### Chapter 5 Grit Grows

**Grit and Genetics**

**Nature vs. Nurture Question:**
- Human traits influenced by both genes and experience
- Height: heritable but also affected by nutrition, environment, etc.

**Genetic Influence on Traits:**
- Every human trait has genetic components
- Dramatic generational gains in height not due to DNA changes
- Nutrition, clean air/water, modern medicine contribute to height increase
- Environment influences development of traits within a generation

**Genetic vs. Environmental Factors in Skill Development:**
- Talents are genetically influenced but not entirely genetic
- Nature (genes) determines potential; nurture (experience) determines rate of skill development.

#### Genetics and Environment: Nature vs. Nurture in Determining Traits

**Impact of Coaching on Swimming Talent**
- **Dan Chambliss**: Stopped competing in high school due to lack of nationally ranked potential
- Anatomical limitation: couldn't flex feet properly (plantar flexion)
- Research shows good coaching can make a difference in performance
  - Improved coaching led Dan to swim at same speed as high school

**Genetics and Grit**
- Studies on identical vs. fraternal twins determine trait heritability
- Identical twins share all DNA, fraternal twins share about half
- Heritability of grit subscales: perseverance (37%), passion (20%)
- No single gene determines grit; polygenic inheritance (multiple genes) influences human traits.

**Complexity of Genetic Influence**
- Traits influenced by more than one gene (polygenic inheritance)
- Height: at least 697 different genes influencing it
- Interaction between genes and environmental factors
- Human genome contains around 25,000 genes with complex interactions.

#### The Flynn Effect: Rising IQ Scores over Time

**Key Points:**
* **Grit and Talent**: Influenced by both genes and experience.
* **No Single Gene**: No single gene responsible for psychological traits like grit or talent.
* **Heritability Estimates**: Explain variability within a population, but not the average itself.
* **The Flynn Effect**: Significant increase in IQ scores over the past century, with bigger gains in abstract reasoning skills.
* **Doubting the Flynn Effect**: Initially disbelieved the idea of such rapid increase in intelligence.
* **Jim Flynn's Explanation**: Improvements in certain IQ subtests (abstract reasoning) can be attributed to environmental factors, like exposure to television and basketball examples given in the text.

#### The Social Multiplier Effect and Generational Changes in Grit

**Basketball Competition and the Social Multiplier Effect:**
- Basketball has become more competitive due to increased exposure on television (Flynn)
- Television fueled popularity and skill development among children
- Children learn from each other, creating a virtuous cycle of skill improvement
- This concept is known as the "social multiplier effect"

**Generational Changes in Abstract Reasoning:**
- Jobs and daily life require more analytical thinking
- Students are asked to reason instead of rely on rote memorization
- Small environmental differences or genetic factors can trigger a virtuous cycle
- Effects are multiplied socially through culture, enriching the learning environment for all

**Grit Scale and Age:**
- Grit scores vary by age (Flynn effect)
- Older adults are grittier than younger ones (reverse Flynn effect?)
- Possible explanations: cultural changes or maturation processes as people grow older.

**Implications:**
- The Greatest Generation may be grittier due to different cultural values and norms
- Millennials may have fewer emphasized sustained passion and perseverance
- Alternatively, age trends could reflect how people mature over time.

#### "Personality Development and Life Experience: The Maturity Principle"

**Grit Development:**
- Grit grows as we figure out life philosophy
- Learn from rejection and disappointment
- Distinguish between short-term and long-term goals
- Maturity story: develop capacity for passion and perseverance with age

**Longitudinal Studies:**
- Follow people over their lives for accurate results
- George Vaillant's study on Harvard men as an example
- Changes in personality are mainly due to life experiences

**Personality Evolution:**
- Most of us become more conscientious, confident, caring, and calm with age
- Changes occur throughout the entire life span
- Puberty and menopause also contribute to personality development
- Personality change is mostly a result of life experiences

**Insights from Life Experiences:**
- Repeatedly swapping goals is unfulfilling
- Expertise requires hard work and perseverance
- Innate talent vs. passion
- Overextension leads to second nature abilities.

#### The Power of Consequences in Maturity Development

**Maturity Principle: Adapting to Circumstances**

**Parenting Challenges**:
- Parents get older, and children become caretakers
- New situations require different behavior from the past

**Adaptability**:
- Humans are incredibly adaptable species
- We change when we need to

**Necessity as a Catalyst for Change**:
- Necessity is the mother of adaptation
- Trivial example: potty training
  - Lucy, a three-year-old, refused to use the potty
  - New preschool classroom without diapers triggered potty training

**Maturity Principle**:
- Behavior change can happen suddenly in response to consequences
  - Daughter's job requiring punctuality led to immediate behavior change

**Headmaster's Perspective**:
- Maturity is a result of learning life lessons and adapting to circumstances
- Consequences have a greater impact than lectures

**Limitations of Parental Influence**:
- Bernie Noe, headmaster of Lakeside School, acknowledges limited influence on maturity development
  - Businesses don't care about kids feeling special; they demand delivery

#### Understanding Grit: The Psychological Assets of Persistence

**Grit and Aging: Adaptations and Identity Evolution**

**Story 1:** Grit changes with cultural eras
- Our grit adapts to the era we grow up in

**Story 2:** Grit increases with age
- We become more grittier as we get older

**Both Stories Could Be True**
- Both stories reflect different aspects of grit development

**Grit Plasticity**
- Understanding your current state is crucial for growth
- If you're not as gritty as desired:
  - Identify the reasons behind quitting goals
  - "I’m just lazy" or similar statements are often wrong
  - People drop out due to various reasons
    * Boredom
    * Effort not worth it
    * Lack of importance
    * Inability to do it
- Paragons of grit don't swap compasses
  - They persist through challenges

**Grit Development Insights**
- Conversations with gritty individuals reveal psychological assets
  * Passion begins with intrinsic enjoyment
    + Every gritty person enjoys less enjoyable aspects
    + Put up with chores they don't enjoy
  * Interest develops first in the process of getting grittier

**Systematic Studies and Qualitative Research**
- Complement each other in understanding grit development
- Reveal common psychological assets of mature gritty individuals.

#### The Psychology of Grit: Cultivating Perseverance

**The Development of Grit**

**Enduring Fascination and Curiosity**:
- People are captivated by their work and projects with "childlike curiosity"
- They have a deep, abiding interest in what they do

**Practice and Perseverance**:
- The ability to practice daily and improve
- Focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice leads to mastery
- Resisting complacency and the "whatever it takes" mindset

**Purpose and Connection**:
- Convinction that one's work matters both personally and to others
- Interest without purpose is difficult to sustain over a lifetime

**Hope and Persistence**:
- Hope as the ability to keep going even when things are difficult
- Getting back up after being knocked down

**Assessing Grit**:
- The Grit Scale: 5 out of 5 represents deep, abiding interest, constant challenge, sense of purpose, and buoyant confidence
- For those not as gritty as they wish to be, the following chapters can provide guidance on developing the psychological assets of interest, practice, purpose, and hope.

#### The Power of Deliberate Practice: Mastery Through Focus and Goals

**Deliberate Practice vs. Casual Practice:**
- Experts practice deliberately for thousands of hours over years
- Not just any practice leads to excellence: deliberate practice is key
- Experts have specific goals and targets during training sessions
- They keep track of their progress (e.g., pace, distance, heart rate)

**Learning Curve:**
- Improvement slows down as skills develop further
- Reaching elite levels takes years of hard work
- The 'ten thousand hour rule' and 'ten year rule' give a sense of the required investment

**Examples of Deliberate Practice:**
- International performers: gradual improvement through deliberate practice
- Martha Graham, dancer: took ten years to make a mature dancer
- Telegraph operators: fluency in Morse code requires years of hard apprenticeship

**Importance of Specific Goals:**
- Having a specific goal for training is crucial for improvement
- Examples: improving running pace or distance, keeping track of progress

**Consequences of Lacking Specific Goals:**
- The author's jogging experience: no significant improvement over time
- Running without a specific goal or target in mind.

#### Deliberate Practice: Focusing on Weaknesses for Expert Performance

**Deliberate Practice for Experts**

**No Variety in Routine**:
- Every run was like the last
- No improvement because of lack of deliberate practice

**Expert Practicing Habits**:
- **Set stretch goals**: Zeroing in on specific weaknesses to improve
- **Intentional challenges**: Seeking out tasks they can't yet meet
- **Strive for reach stretch goal**: With undivided attention and great effort
- **Seek feedback**: Necessarily negative, essential for improvement
- **Active processing of feedback**: As important as its immediacy

**Learning from Ulrik Christensen**:
- Adaptive learning software entrepreneur
- Developed virtual reality game to teach doctors proper cardiac handling
- Struggled with a physician who couldn't finish the training
- Stopped him before next feedback, asked about uncertain decisions
- Reflected on what he knew and didn't know

#### "Developing Skill Through Deliberate Practice and Feedback"

**The Importance of Effortful Deliberate Practice for Achieving Flow**

**Effortful Deliberate Practice**:
- Not fun at first, but worth it for the "Aha" moments of challenge-meeting-skill flow
- Explains why elite performance can look effortless

**Example: Katie Ledecky's Swimming Career**
- Started swimming at 6 years old
- Developed a reputation for working hard in practice
- Credits her success to the "work put in" and being in shape

**Author's Story of Effortful Deliberate Practice**
- Offered a TED talk opportunity
- Faced "feedback" (constructive criticism) from TED leadership
- Realized they were experienced storytellers, and he needed their feedback to improve
- Rewrote the talk and practiced before delivering it successfully

#### The Joy of Deliberate Practice: Gritty Performers' Perspective

**Experience of Deliberate Practice:**

**Importance of avoiding distractions during presentations:**
- Biting lips when nervous is distracting for audience
- Refine techniques for better presentations

**Personal Growth through Deliberate Practice:**
- Transformation from weak resemblance to improved talk
- Enjoyment and improvement over time
- Grittier performers report:
  * More enjoyable and effortful deliberate practice
  * Longer hours of deliberate practice compared to others

**Perception of Deliberate Practice:**
- Frustrating, uncomfortable, painful for some
- Positive experiences reported by grittier performers
- Rewards of labor lead to enjoyment over time or personal taste for challenges?

**Grittier Performers:**
- Spend more hours on deliberate practice than others
- Rate it as both more enjoyable and effortful.

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Grittier kids develop a taste for hard work and enjoy it more over time (learn to love the burn)
2. Grittier kids enjoy hard work, leading them to do more of it (enjoyment drives more practice)
3. Both explanations hold true to some extent.
4. Effort's subjective experience can change with reward or personal preference.
5. Personal growth leads to increased enjoyment and acceptance of deliberate practice.

### Chapter 8 Purpose

**Purpose and Passion**

**Purpose**:
- Another source of passion beyond interest
- Intention to contribute to the well-being of others
- Mature passions of gritty people depend on both purpose and interest

**Two Types of Progression:**
1. **For some, purpose comes first**:
   - Example: Alex Scott (Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation)
   - Not common but possible
2. **More common sequence**:
   - Self-oriented interest first
   - Learn self-disciplined practice
   - Integrate work with other-centered purpose

**Benjamin Bloom's Three Phases:**
1. **Early years**: Development of personal interests
2. **Middle years**: Mastery through self-discipline and practice
3. **Later years**: The larger purpose and meaning becomes apparent

**Purpose in Gritty People**:

   * Diagnosed with lupus and given limited life expectancy
   * Took over a small anti-graffiti program in Philadelphia that grew into one of the largest public art programs in the world
   * Continues to work tirelessly due to her sense of service and moral imperative: "Art saves lives"
3. **Antonio Galloni**: A renowned wine critic with a passion for sharing his appreciation for wine with others, helping them understand their own palates.
   * Believes he is making the world better in this small way, despite not curing cancer or performing brain surgery
   * Wakes up every morning with a sense of purpose: "I think I’m going to make a million lightbulbs go off"

**The Connection Between Work and Others:**
- Grit paragons deeply connect their work to the well-being of others, seeing it as a moral imperative.
- Single-minded focus on a top-level goal may not necessarily be more selfless than selfish; purpose plays an essential role in driving their actions.

#### Hedonic vs Eudaimonic Happiness: The Role of Purpose in Grit

**Aristotle's Perspective on Happiness**
- Recognized two ways to pursue happiness: **eudaimonic** (in harmony with inner spirit) and **hedonic** (positive, self-centered experiences)
- Eudaimonic life seen as noble and pure, hedonic as primitive and vulgar

**Evolutionary Roots of Happiness Seeking**
- Pleasure: Increases chances for survival (e.g., food, sex)
- Drive to connect with others promotes survival (cooperation)

**Motivations Behind Grit**
- Recruited 16,000 American adults and asked them to complete the Grit Scale questionnaire
- Assessed participants' orientations towards **purpose** and **pleasure**

**Findings on Purpose vs. Pleasure in Grit**
- Gritty people are not monks or hedonists: Moderate pleasure seeking, strongly motivated by purpose
- Higher scores on purpose correlate with higher scores on the Grit Scale
- Most gritty people see their ultimate aims as deeply connected to the world beyond themselves.

- Dogs who controlled shocks learned to leap barrier on shuttle box
- Dogs without control became passive and helpless

**Impact of Control:**
- Suffering itself does not lead to hopelessness
- It's the belief that suffering cannot be controlled that causes helplessness.

#### The Impact of Optimism on Success and Mental Health

**Impact of Optimism vs. Pessimism on Life Outcomes:**

**Permanent and Pervasive Explanations for Adversity**:
- Examples: "I screw up everything," or "I'm a loser"
- These explanations are **permanent** and **pervasive**, influencing multiple life situations
- Lead to feelings of hopelessness and giving up

**Temporary and Specific Explanations for Adversity**:
- Examples: "I mismanaged my time," or "I didn't work efficiently"
- These explanations are **temporary** and **specific**, motivating problem-solving and improvement

**Effects of Optimism vs. Pessimism:**

- Afterward, children given easy and difficult problems to do
- Findings:
  + Success only program: no improvement in handling difficulty
  + Attribution retraining program: increased effort upon encountering difficulty

**Carol's Research on Intelligence:**
- People have inherent theories about intelligence
- These beliefs are unconscious, often unaware until probed
- Assessing a person’s theory of intelligence: four statements
  1. Your intelligence is something unchangeable
  2. You can't change your basic level of intelligence
  3. Intelligence can be changed substantially through effort and support
  4. No matter your current intelligence, it can be altered significantly
- Fixed mindset vs growth mindset:
  + Fixed mindset: believes people can't change fundamental abilities
  + Growth mindset: assumes that with the right opportunities, effort, and belief, one can improve their skills and intelligence.

#### Fixed vs Growth Mindset: The Power of Language in Shaping Success

**The Growth Mindset: Embracing Learning and Grit**

* Quote from James Baldwin: "Children have never been very good at listening to their elders, but they have never failed to imitate them."
* Daeun Park's study on fixed vs. growth mindsets in first and second graders:
	+ Teachers who favor high performers and emphasize comparison promote fixed mindset
	+ Students agree that people cannot change their intelligence level
	+ Prefer easy tasks to avoid mistakes
* Corporate setting: growth-minded companies foster innovation, trustworthiness, and risk taking
* Personal reflection: acknowledging the tendency towards fixed mindset despite best intentions.

#### Cultivating a Growth Mindset: Overcoming Fixed-Mindset Challenges

**Mindset and Growth:**
* Aspire for calm, encouraging attitude towards mistakes
* Human beings have inner fixed-mindset pessimist and optimist
* Recognize the presence of both mindsets

* Belief in self and the world determines actions.

**Bill McNabb's Perspective:**
* CEO of Vanguard, largest provider of mutual funds
* Observed difference between successful and unsuccessful leaders

#### The Neurobiology of Resilience: Learning from Stressful Experiences

**Effects of Stress on Rats:**
- **Resilient rats**: Those who experienced stress they could control grew up to be more adventurous and were inoculated against learned helplessness as adults.
- **Adolescent stage**: The crucial period for this effect is during adolescence, when the rats faced electric shocks they could control their own duration.
- **Learned Helplessness**: This refers to the behavior of rats who, after experiencing uncontrollable stressors, become helpless and timid in response to further stress.
- **Experimental Design**: Rats were divided into two groups: one group received electric shocks they could control by turning a wheel, while the other group had no control over the shocks' duration.

**Key Findings:**
- **Adolescent rats who experienced controllable stress** grew up to be more adventurous and resilient against learned helplessness in adulthood.
- **Adolescent rats who experienced uncontrollable stress** became timid and vulnerable to learned helplessness as adults.

**Neurobiology of Hope:**
- Steve Maier explained that the neurobiology of hope is a complex phenomenon, but he had not yet fully explored it in his research on rats.

#### "Developing Resilience: The Role of Early-life Experiences in Coping with Adversity"

**The Brain's Response to Aversive Experiences**

**Limbic Structures**:
- Respond to stressful experiences (e.g., amygdala)
- Regulated by higher-order brain areas, like the prefrontal cortex

**Inhibitory Structures in the Cortex**:
- Activated when one has a sense of control or belief that they can do something about a situation
- Send a message to "cool it down" and not get overly activated

**Plasticity in Circuitry**:
- Experiencing adversity, especially if overcome during youth, can lead to different ways of dealing with adversity later on
- This requires the activation of control circuitry and low-level areas at the same time

**Concerns about Helplessness Experiences**:
- Children in poverty may have many helplessness experiences without enough mastery experiences
- This can have enduring effects, as they have not learned that their actions can affect outcomes

**Fragile Perfects**:
- Individuals who have cruised through life without much friction or failure
- Lack practice in failing and getting back up again
- May struggle to adapt when encountering real challenges for the first time

- Higher grades in school, self-reliance, fewer anxiety and depression symptoms, less delinquent behavior (Steinberg study)
- Replicable across nations and stages of child development
- Longitudinal research indicates benefits last a decade or more

**Understanding Parenting Styles:**
- Context matters: judging parents based on limited exchanges is misleading
- Warm, respectful, and demanding parenting can vary in perception

**Assessing Psychological Wisdom of Parenting:**
- Use Nancy Darling's parenting assessment (see below) as a checklist

**Parenting Assessment:**

**Supportive:**
- Warm: "I can count on my parents to help me out if I have a problem"
    * Reverse-coded: "My parents don’t really like me to tell them my troubles"
- Respectful: "My parents believe I have a right to my own point of view"
    * Reverse-coded: "My parents tell me that their ideas are correct and that I shouldn't question them"
- Fun activities together
- Privacy respect
- Freedom
- Decision making

**Demanding:**
- Follow family rules
- Accountability for actions
- High expectations

**Benefits of Supportive and Demanding Parenting on Grit:**
- Encourages children to emulate parents' behaviors.

#### Parental Influence: Imitation Versus Emulation in Developing Grit

**Imitation vs. Emulation**

**Imitation**:
- Young children strongly imitate the accents, habits, and attitudes of adults around them
- Children who witness adults playing quietly tend to follow suit
- Children who witness adults being aggressive tend to become aggressive themselves, closely mimicking what they've seen

**Emulation**:
- As we grow older, we develop the capacity to reflect on our actions and pass judgment
- We become especially eager to pursue the same interests as our parents/models
- This process of emulating others is key to developing grit

**Parental Influence**:
- Parents who are "hard workers" and encourage their children's participation in favored activities have a strong influence on their child's development of grit
- The supportive and demanding nature of the parents plays a crucial role

**Conclusion**:
- Not all children with psychologically wise parents will grow up to be gritty, as it depends on whether the parents model grittiness and long-term goal pursuit.

### Chapter 11 The Playing Fields of Grit

**The Playing Fields of Grit**

**Importance of Extracurricular Activities**:
- Adult in charge is not the parent
- Designed to cultivate interest, practice, purpose, and hope
- Examples: ballet, piano, football, structured activities

**Recommendation for Parents**:
- Find something child may enjoy outside of school
- Sign them up
- Suggestion: all children engage in at least one extracurricular activity
- Highly suggestive research evidence

**Research Findings**:
- Kids report feeling challenged in class, but unmotivated
- Hanging out with friends is less challenging but more fun

**Potential Benefits of Extracurricular Activities**:
- Cultivating grit and resilience
- Developing interests and skills
- Providing opportunities for socialization and teamwork.

#### The Long-Term Benefits of Extracurricular Activities

**The Benefits of Extracurricular Activities**

**Combination of Challenge and Intrinsic Motivation:**
- School is challenging but not always interesting
- Extracurricular activities offer both challenge and fun
- Reliable source for young people to experience this combination

**Long-Term Benefits:**
- Numerous research studies show better outcomes for kids involved in extracurriculars
  - Better grades, higher self-esteem, less likely to get into trouble
  - Longitudinal studies confirm longer-term benefits

**Grit and Extracurricular Activities:**
- Practicing grit through long-term involvement in activities
- Overdosing on extracurriculars is rare
  - Average American teenager spends over three hours a day watching TV, playing video games, and using social media

**Long-Term Participation:**
- Lessons learned from improving a skill for more than one season
- Future NFL Hall of Famer Steve Young's example: wooden football training

**Margo Gardner Study:**
- Followed 11,000 American teenagers until age 26
- Kids who spent more than one year in extracurricular activities were significantly more likely to graduate from college, volunteer in their communities as adults, and have jobs with higher pay.

#### The Importance of Personal Qualities Beyond Grades and Test Scores

**Warren Willingham's Study on Extracurricular Activities**

**Background:**
- Warren Willingham: director of Personal Qualities Project (1978)
- Funded by Educational Testing Service (ETS)
- Focused on identifying determinants of success in young adulthood
- ETS is known for standardized testing, e.g., SAT, GRE, TOEFL

**Motivation:**
- High school grades and test scores poor predictors of later life success
- Willingham sought to identify other personal qualities that matter

**Methodology:**
- Followed several thousand high school seniors for five years
- Collected information through college: application materials, questionnaires, interviews, school records
- Numerical ratings produced for over one hundred personal characteristics
- Measured academic success, leadership abilities, significant accomplishments in various fields

**Findings:**
- Initial report dispassionate about which variable might be strongest predictor of later success
- Final data analysis revealed unequivocal answer:
  - Specific personal qualities not as strong predictors as previously thought
  - Emphasis on the importance of following through with extracurricular activities for future success.

#### The Power of Follow-Through in Predicting Success

**The Study on Follow-through:**
* The study found that "follow-through" was a significant predictor of success in various domains
* Students who participated in multiyear high school extracurricular activities and made progress earned top ratings
* Those who didn't participate or were itinerant earned the lowest ratings
* Follow-through was more predictive than grades, SAT scores, or personal characteristics
* The specific pursuits did not matter; progress in any activity was key
* Researcher Willingham found similarities between "follow-through" and grit
* Wanted to replicate findings using the Grit Scale due to its potential resistance to gaming.

#### "Grit Grid: A Measure of Persistence and Commitment"

**Grit Research: Predicting College Persistence**

**Background:**
- Dropout rates high in U.S. colleges
- Gates Foundation interested in why students drop out
- Importance of follow-through and grit identified as key factor

**Research Approach:**
1. Recruited 1,200 seniors for study
2. Asked about extracurricular activities, length of participation, achievements, awards, leadership positions (Grit Grid)
3. Calculated Grit Grid scores based on multiyear commitment and advancement in up to two activities
4. Students could score from 0 to 6 points
5. Higher scores correlated with self-rated grit and teacher evaluations

**Findings:**
- Students with higher Grit Grid scores:
  * Showed more commitment
  * Advanced in their extracurricular activities
  * Demonstrated high achievement
- Correlation between self-ratings, teacher evaluations, and Grit Grid scores.

#### Extracurriculars, Grit, and Personality Development

**Grit and College Persistence**

**College Attendance Statistics**:
- After two years, only 34% of 1,200 students were still enrolled in college
- Grit Grid scores heavily influenced college attendance:
    - 69% of students scoring 6 out of 6 on the Grit Grid were still in college
    - 16% of students scoring 0 out of 6 were still enrolled

**Extracurriculars and Teacher Persistence**:
- College extracurricular participation correlated with teacher persistence and effectiveness
- No relationship between teacher SAT scores, college GPAs, or interviewer ratings

**Interpretation**:
- Explanations:
    - Extracurriculars are a way to develop passion and perseverance for long-term goals
    - Gritty people are more likely to follow through with extracurricular commitments
- Both factors (cultivation and selection) may be at play

**Personality Development and the Correspondence Principle**:
- Prevailing view: Personalities become "set like plaster" after childhood
- Longitudinal research shows personalities do change, through a process of correspondence
    - Situations call for certain personality traits, which reinforce and amplify those traits
    - Potential for virtuous or vicious cycles (e.g., hostility leading to lower job prestige and further increases in hostility)

#### The Impact of Extracurricular Activities on College Admissions

**Impact of Psychological Development in Adolescence:**

**Nice Kids vs. Quitters**
- Agreeable adolescents enter a virtuous cycle of psychological development
- Secure higher-status jobs offering greater financial security and enhanced sociability

**Vicious Cycle of Giving Up:**
- Child who gives up easily may miss opportunities to enter virtuous cycle of struggle, progress, and confidence
- Repeatedly giving up reinforces the habit of quitting challenges

**Positive Reinforcement through Challenges:**
- A little girl who persists in difficult tasks, like ballet, learns to welcome challenge and improve her abilities
- Breakthroughs encourage further commitment to challenging activities

**The Role of College Admissions:**
- Some students admitted based on academic merit for potential to become world-class academics
- Others admitted due to demonstrated follow-through, energy, discipline, and hard work in extracurricular activities
- Harvard Dean of Admissions, Bill Fitzsimmons, recognizes the importance of follow-through in applications.

#### The Power of Extracurricular Activities in Developing Grit

**Bill's Insights on Grit and Extracurricular Activities:**
* Transferable skills from athletics can be applied to other areas
* Harvard admissions staff use a similar rating scale to assess applicants' grit
* Follow-through in activities is crucial for developing character and priorities
* Some students are encouraged to employ their hard work and grit, leading to success
* Extracurricular activities can be transformative experiences
* Widening gap between rich and poor students in extracurricular participation:
	+ Pay-to-play sports and music programs create barriers for low-income families.
	+ Lack of transportation hinders participation for some families.
	+ Costs of private lessons, instruments, or uniforms can be prohibitive.

#### The Impact of Decent Childhoods on Academic Success

**Relationship Between Family Income and Grit Grid Scores**
- **Correlation found between family income and Grit Grid scores**: High school seniors from low-income families had an average of 1 point lower Grit Grid scores than more privileged students.

**Geoffrey Canada and the Harlem Children's Zone**
- **Geoffrey Canada**: Harvard-trained social scientist, passionate about helping kids in poverty realize their potential
- Founded the Harlem Children's Zone (HCZ), a radically intensive education program in New York City
- First graduates are now in college and HCZ's comprehensive approach has attracted national attention
- **Discussion with the Author**:
  - Canada emphasized the need for providing children from poverty with a "decent childhood"
  - Though some aspects of the program lack scientific evidence, he believes in providing extracurricular activities because he "actually likes kids"

**Research on Extracurricular Activities and Academic Success**
- **Short-term experiments**: Have shown that doing hard tasks can help individuals master other difficult tasks
- However, scientists have not yet determined the logistics and ethics of conducting long-term studies on randomly assigning kids to specific extracurricular activities.

#### Learning Industriousness Through Effort-Reward Association

**Psychologist Robert Eisenberger's Research on Learned Industriousness:**

**Background:**
- Robert Eisenberger: leading authority on learned industriousness

   - Rats assigned to hard or easy tasks for reward
   - Subsequent tasks showed increased vigor and endurance in hard condition
2. Effects of Food Acquisition Methods:
   - Rats trained on hoppers (require gnawing) performed better than those with scattered food pellets
3. Conclusion:
   - Hard work association learned through experience
   - Default to laziness without connection between effort and reward

**Experiments with Children:**
1. Similar Findings:
   - Increased performance on tasks following difficult training tasks
2. Short-Term Versions of Experiments:
   - Pennies given for counting, memorizing, or matching shapes
   - Difficulty increased with progress or kept easy
3. Results:
   - Children who trained on difficult tasks worked harder on subsequent task (copying list of words)
4. Conclusion:
   - Learned industriousness in children

**Conclusions:**
- Hard work association can be learned through experience
- Default to laziness without connection between effort and reward.

   - Not on a "bad day" or because of temporary frustration
3. Interest-driven choices:
   - Girls get to choose their own hard things
4. Long-term commitment:
   - High school daughters must commit to at least one activity for two years
5. Benefits of the Hard Thing Rule:
   - Encourages grit development
   - Fosters self-discipline and responsibility
   - Provides opportunities for growth and improvement
6. Parental support:
   - Encourage interest in hard things

- Identity plays a crucial role in critical gritty decisions

**Decision Making and Identity:**
- Cost-benefit analysis is not always necessary for decision making
- Decisions based on identity can be more powerful than cost-benefit considerations

#### Overcoming Adversity Through Persistence: Tom Deierlein's Story

**The Logic of Action vs. Instinctive Response**

**Consequences of Actions**:
- Not always thought through logically
- Benefits, costs, risks not always considered

#### "The Misconception of Genius and Talent in Education"

**Chapter 2: Distracted by Talent in the Classroom**

**Best Teacher at School:**
- Neil Dorosin, Teach For America alumnus and best teacher at school (Daniel Oscar's creation)
- Danial and Neil are still active in education reform

**Learning Abilities:**
- **Easy learning**: not specified whose learning came easy
- Francis Galton: heredity misconceptions
	+ Fascination with heredity was misguided
	+ Importance of zeal, hard work, and ability supported by modern research
	+ Erroneous conclusions about heredity and race not supported
- Charles Darwin's letter to Francis Galton (1869)
	+ Emphasis on importance of effort and talent
- Multiple intelligences: Howard Gardner, Frames of Mind; Ellen Winner, Gifted Children

**Perceptions of Talents:**
- People often perceive talents as plural
- Robert J. Sternberg and James C. Kaufman: Human Abilities
	+ Discussion on various human abilities
- Surveys suggest people believe in the power of effort over natural ability
	+ 60 Minutes / Vanity Fair Poll (2010)
		* Endorsement of "intelligence"
		* More likely to succeed based on effort rather than natural ability
- Chia-Jung Tsay and Mahzarin R. Banaji's research:
	+ "Naturals and Strivers: Preferences and Beliefs About Sources of Achievement" (2011)
		* People tend to rate those perceived as "naturally gifted" higher than those who work hard to improve their skills.
- Chia-Jung Tsay's research (2015):
	+ The cost of the "naturalness bias": undervaluing effort and overvaluing natural ability

#### Evaluating the War for Talent: Its Impact on Achievement and Perception of Genius

**Discussion of Talent and Achievement**

**Juilliard Pre-College**:
- Technical skills can flourish at Juilliard Pre-College
- Self-fulfilling prophecy plays a role

**The War for Talent**:
- Initial study by McKinsey & Company:
  - "War for Talent" became a best-selling book
  - "What do we mean by talent?"
- Critique of the study:
  - Comparing SAT scores to job performance is flawed
  - The study's focus on being "bright" was self-serving
  - The study did not account for factors like luck and effort

**Grit and Potential**:
- Scott Barry Kaufman's perspective:
  - **Grit** and potential, not just aptitude, determine success
  - Some individuals deemed "insufficiently bright" go on to achieve great things
  - The idea of **democratization of genius** is appealing, but problematic
- Darrin McMahon's perspective:
  - Genius incites ambivalence due to competing desires for meritocracy and equality

#### Overcoming Obstacles: Remarkable Lives without Labeled Genius

**The Achievements of Non-Prodigies:** Darrin and Michael Lomax's Stories

**Darrin:**
- Meticulously researched book about his life
- Humorously acknowledges lack of genius in his abilities
- Childhood experiences: not identified as gifted, tested for gifted program but didn't pass
- Spent years trying to prove himself
- Stubborn and determined despite early labeling

**Michael Lomax:**
- President and CEO of United Negro College Fund
- Previous leadership positions at Dillard University, Morehouse College, Emory University, and mayoral candidate for Atlanta
- Didn't consider himself the smartest kid growing up
- Mother wrote to Morehouse College to request admission
- Admitted without formal application, never took SAT before being admitted to college
- Struggled in college but graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in English
- Earned master's and doctoral degrees from Columbia University and Emory University respectively
- Believes it's character rather than genius that drives success at his age (68)

**Commonalities:**
- Neither identified as gifted or prodigies during their childhood
- Overcame early labels and self-doubt to achieve great success.

#### Effort, Determination, and Talent: Key Factors in Excellence

**The Importance of Hard Work and Persistence**

**Daniel F. Chambliss's Research on Olympic Swimmers**:
- **The Mundanity of Excellence**: 
    - Emphasizes the importance of hard work, persistence, and small skills in achieving excellence
    - Contrasts this with the "cult of the genius" and the notion that talent is inborn
- Chambliss found that:
    - **Dozens of small skills** are crucial for athletic success
    - These skills can be learned through practice and determination
    - **Anatomical advantages** alone do not distinguish the best athletes

**Nietzsche's Perspective on Human Flourishing**:
- In his work **"Human, All Too Human"**, Nietzsche emphasizes that:
    - **Talent and inborn gifts** are not the sole determinants of success
    - **Effort and hard work** are crucial for human flourishing
    - Skills can be acquired through continuous practice and improvement

**Positive Psychology's Perspective on Talent**:
- According to Marty Seligman, founder of Positive Psychology:
    - **Talent is not fixed**; it is the rate at which individuals acquire skills
    - Skills can be learned through practice and dedication

**Research on Factors Influencing Skill Acquisition**:
- David Hambrick's work suggests that factors beyond practice influence skill acquisition:
    - **Genetics, motivation, and arousal** all play roles in how quickly individuals learn skills

#### IQ Gains, Personality Development, and Autonomous Motivation

**Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)**
- The Wechsler tests are published by Pearson's Clinical Assessment
- Information on Flynn Effect comes from personal communications with James Flynn between 2006 and 2015
- For more information, see:
  - **James R. Flynn**, "Are We Getting Smarter?: Rising IQ in the Twenty-First Century" (Cambridge University Press, 2012)
  - Jakob Pietschnig and Martin Voracek, "One Century of Global IQ Gains: A Formal Meta-Analysis of the Flynn Effect (1909–2013)" in **Perspectives on Psychological Science** 10 (2015): 282–306
- Key findings:
  - IQ gains are ubiquitous and positive over the past century
  - Gains have varied in magnitude by domain of intelligence
  - Gains have been less dramatic in recent years
  - Candidate causes include social multiplier effects, changes in education, nutrition, hygiene, medical care, and test-taking sophistication
  - The **"social multiplier effect"** is discussed in: William T. Dickens and James R. Flynn, "Heritability Estimates Versus Large Environmental Effects: The IQ Paradox Resolved," **Psychological Review** 108 (2001): 346–69

**Grit and Age**
- Data originally reported in Duckworth et al., "Grit"
- Avshalom Caspi, Brent W. Roberts, and Rebecca L. Shiner, **"Personality Development: Stability and Change,"** **Annual Review of Psychology** 56 (2005): 453–84
- Key findings:
  - Personality traits become more **conscientious, confident, caring, and calm** with age
  - This is known as the **"maturity principle"**, discussed in Caspi et al. at p. 468
  - Grit and autonomous motivation are positively correlated (author's findings)
- Ken M. Sheldon's work on **enjoyment** and **importance** as components of **autonomously motivated goals**
  - All of us have responsibilities we must fulfill out of obligation or necessity
  - Accomplishing externally motivated goals rarely fulfills us in the way that interesting and purposeful goals do
  - People lacking in autonomous motivation are less likely to accomplish their goals, even when they derive less satisfaction from achieving them.
