### Foreword

**The Power of Storytelling in Leadership Development**

**Prakash's Journey**:
- Known Prakash from Unilever as a successful manager
- Witnessed his evolution into an inspiring leader

**The Book**:
- Disseminates insights gained through leading teams across different companies and challenging circumstances
- Written in a charming, non-prescriptive manner to stimulate reflection on what it takes to be a successful manager and leader
- Draws significant lessons from nature, sports, and daily life experiences

**Leadership Schools of Thought**:
- One believes leadership is innate and cannot be taught
- The other strongly believes leadership can be learned
- Prakash belongs to the latter group

**Learning Through Storytelling**:
- Storytelling creates a connect with the audience and fosters reflection
- Anecdotes unite ideas with emotions, making them easily relatable
- Stories cover all the practical lessons budding managers need to transform into future leaders and winners

**The Value of Traditional Storytelling**:
- In India, there are traditions of storytelling like jatra, Upanyasam, and harikatha that have evolved over centuries
- Storytelling is a great preservative for ideas because both the idea and the drama get indelibly etched in one's mind

**The Gaining Prominence of Narrative Style in Management**:
- Narrative and anecdotal style are gaining prominence to simplify and demystify the esoteric world of management
- This is done in a manner that profound lessons are imparted with poise and elegance, leaving enough for the reader to reflect upon

**The Importance of Standing Still**:
- The author tells the story of a soccer goalkeeper's bias towards action, even when standing still may have been the most effective route
- This concept is seen in various contexts, such as acquiring and downsizing businesses or stopping an advertising campaign

**Dealing with Unknown Issues**:
- As leadership roles increase in ambiguity, leaders need to understand the root causes of this ambiguity
- In a climate of uncertainty, maps (equivalent to factual, functional, and analytical knowledge) can help with known problems, but a compass (intuitive, experiential knowledge) is required for unknown issues

**The Author's Contribution**:
- The book covers the many facets of leadership, providing opportunities for readers to reflect and develop their intuitive compass.

### II SELF-BELIEF. Karoly Takacs and the Winners Mindset

**Károly Takács and the Winner's Mindset**

**Sport as a Metaphor for Life**:
- Watching sports on TV or reading about athletes can be an opportunity to understand their mindset
- The story of Károly Takács, a Hungarian pistol shooter, is an inspiring metaphor for overcoming adversity

**Károly Takács' Life Story**:
- In 1938, at 28 years old, Károly was the top pistol shooter in Hungary
- Favorite to win gold at the 1940 Tokyo Olympic Games
- Lost his right shooting hand in a grenade explosion at an army training session
- Instead of focusing on what he had lost, Károly chose to focus on what he still had:
  - Mental strength
  - Determination to succeed
  - A healthy left hand

**Training with his Left Hand**:
- Began practicing with his left hand after a month in the hospital
- Endured pain and strain as he transformed his left hand into the world's best shooting hand

**Competing with his Left Hand**:
- Won the Hungarian national championship in pistol shooting one year later
- Competed at the 1948 London Olympics and won the gold medal
- Repeatedly won gold at the Helsinki Olympics in 1952

**Mindset of a Champion**:
- Károly's story illustrates how winning is less about skills and more about attitude
- When faced with adversity, focus on what you still have: your inner strength, mental toughness
- Pick yourself up quickly, set a goal, and channel your mind and body towards it
- Winning is about the mind, not just the hand

### Break Your Mental Barriers The Roger Bannister Story

**The Roger Bannister Story:**
* In the 1950s, it was believed that no human could run a mile (1.6 km) in less than four minutes
* Gunder Haegg held the record at 4:01.4 seconds since 1945
* Doctors and experts believed breaking the four-minute barrier would cause physical harm
* On May 6, 1954, Roger Bannister defied expectations and ran the mile in 3:59.4 seconds
* John Landy, a rival runner, broke the barrier fifty-six days later with a time of 3:57.9 seconds
* By 1957, sixteen runners had broken the four-minute barrier
* No physiological changes occurred in the runners' bodies; it was solely a mental barrier that was shattered
* Roger Bannister proved that mental barriers limit our beliefs about what we can achieve.

**Mental Barriers:**
* We all have beliefs about what we can and cannot do
* These limitations restrict our efforts and hinder success
* Breaking mental barriers requires challenging the impossible dream
* The story of Roger Bannister demonstrates that mental barriers can be shattered to unlock potential.

- Life examples: finishing second instead of first, missing opportunities

- Fraction of a second can impact outcomes significantly

### The Power of Positive Expectations

**The Power of Positive Expectations: Winner's Mindset**

**Pessimism vs. Optimism**:
- Pessimism is widely accepted as topping the charts in negative feelings
- The power of optimism and positive expectations is not as well-accepted

**The Experiment in a Texas School**:
- Principal handpicked top 30 Grade 7 students for a special class
- Teachers worked extra hard to help them excel in state examination
- Students, parents, and school environment supported their success
- Results showed the class outperformed expectations, despite no exceptional students initially identified

**The Power of Positive Expectations**:
- Teachers' positive expectations of themselves and their students led to harder work and longer hours
- Students' positive expectations based on being handpicked drove them to rise to the challenge
- Environment (parents, school) supported these positive expectations

**Implications for Parents, Leaders, and Individuals**:
- Set high positive expectations for yourself, others, and your surroundings
- Share those expectations openly
- Don't let fear of failure hold you back
- Expectations can make reality fit in

### Who Stole My Cookies

**Stolen Cookies Incident at O'Hare Airport**

**Woman's Experience**:
- Waiting for delayed flight at O'Hare airport
- Bought a pack of favorite cookies (almond and raisin)
- Man on nearby seat helped himself to her cookies without asking
- She was angered by the man's actions, thinking he was a thief
- The man smiled and continued taking her cookies
- She only had one cookie left, which he also took
- Annoyed, she boarded her flight without confronting the man

**Realization**:
- After boarding, she realized she had been eating the other man's cookies
- Felt terrible for her rude behavior towards him
- Realized that similar incidents happen in everyday life
- People often feel others are taking advantage of them (stealing "cookies")
- Importance of being more aware of one's actions and thinking like the man who smiled and shared his "cookies"

**Cows vs. Dogs**:
- Devdutt Pattanaik's analogy: World is full of cows and dogs
- Cows represent givers, sharing their resources (milk) with everyone
- Dogs are takers, claiming territorial rights and fighting for what they want
- Importance of being more like cows, rather than dogs, in life and work

### Changing Mindsets. And the Size-15 Shirt

**Changing Mindsets**

**Driving Change**:
- New leaders face challenges in driving change within an organization
- Change is often opposed, despite being necessary
- Changing behaviors is tough, changing mindsets is even harder
- Outsider syndrome: advice is disregarded due to "not knowing the company"
- "It's always been that way" mentality
- Belief that past success will repeat itself
- Attempts to resist change can lead to confused cause-and-effect linkages

**The Size-15 Shirt**:
- Story of a man who was told he had only 6 months to live, but decided to "live it up"
- He tried to get a size 15 shirt, despite the tailor's warning that it would exacerbate his health issues
- We all hold onto our beliefs and mindsets, refusing to let go
- Just like the man in the story, we often refuse to change our "shirt size" (i.e., our thinking)

**Conclusion**:
- If we only do what we've always done, we'll only get what we've always got
- To drive change, we need to challenge our own mindsets and "change our shirt size"

### Looking through Our Own Glass Windows

**The Story of the Young Couple**
- The couple moved into a new apartment
- One morning, the woman looked out the kitchen window and saw dirty laundry on a line

- The husband suggested they may be using a poor detergent
- A few days later, the woman saw clean laundry hanging outside
- She realized the neighbors had learned to wash clothes correctly
- The husband explained he had cleaned their windows earlier that day

**The Impact of Our Perceptions**
- We do not see things as they are, but as we are
- Our perceptions are influenced by our own experiences and biases
- If we look for faults, we will find them
- If we look for good, we will find it
- It is important to avoid jumping to conclusions about others

**The Window Metaphor**
- The "window" represents our perception of the world
- Our windows are tinted by our experiences and biases
- We can be prone to seeing only what confirms our preconceptions
- Rather than judging others, it is important to clean our own windows

**Conclusion**
- The story illustrates how our perceptions can be distorted by our own biases and experiences
- It is a reminder to avoid making hasty judgments about others
- By "cleaning the windows" of our own biases, we can see the world more clearly

### V GIVING

**The White Rabbit: Overcoming Self-Limiting Beliefs**

- A fairy appeared and told him all the riches he wanted were within reach
- Told him to go to the garden and claim the treasure chest
- Warned him not to think about the white rabbit in the garden, or he would be unable to find the riches

**Self-Limiting Beliefs as White Rabbits**:
- Our goals, dreams, and "just deserts" are within our reach
- But we are held back by our **self-limiting beliefs**, or "white rabbits"
- These beliefs prevent us from rising to our full potential and achieving our goals
- We often blame external factors like childhood, background, education, etc.
- This leads to a cycle of **comparing white rabbits** with others, which strengthens them

**Identifying and Overcoming White Rabbits**:
- It is important to identify your own **white rabbit**, or self-limiting belief
- By acknowledging it, you can begin to **banish it from your mind**
- This allows you to focus on claiming the treasure chest of goals and potential within your reach

### Worklife Balance and the Waugh Brothers

**Work-Life Balance and the Waugh Brothers**

**Parental Dream**:
- Both sons playing for their country in cricket would be a dream come true for most
- Having both twin sons play for Australia would be really special

**The Waugh Family**:
- Steve and Mark plundered runs and made waves in Australian first-class cricket
- The parents longed for the day when both their sons would play for Australia
- Steve made his debut first, bringing joy to the Waugh home
- Mark was also picked for the upcoming Ashes Test, with both twins playing together for Australia

**The Celebration**:
- The Waughs threw a party in their backyard to celebrate
- Pride and bonhomie combined with food and wine

**Mr. Kamath's Perspective on Work-Life Balance**:
- Said it was a nice ideal, but not something to recommend for young high-performance managers
- Advised to focus on work and slog to make an impact, then life will take care of itself
- Trying to find the balance too early could mean missing out on both fronts

**The Waugh Brothers' Career**:
- After Steve made way for Mark in his debut game, the brothers went on to play for several years for Australia
- Winning games, laurels, and a couple of World Cups
- The Waugh dream did come true, but insisting on both brothers making their debut together might have prevented it

**The Price of Success**:
- To get something, you must be ready to give up something
- You cannot have both promotion and leave the office at 5.30 p.m., or lose weight and eat dessert
- Work to make your goals come true, but remember the price you will need to pay

### XI TAKE ACTION. Begin. And End. Nothing Else Matters

**Starting and Completing Tasks**

- The human mind reads words as a whole, not individual letters
- This principle applies to life: getting started is key, rest is "commentary"

**Importance of Finishing Tasks**:
- You don't have to be great to start, but you need to start to be great
- Unfinished tasks are biggest contributors to stress in the workplace
- Successful people finish what they've started
- Take that first step, even if it's "badly" at first

**Action Items**:
- Write the first chapter of a book you want to write
- Complete at least one unfinished task on your to-do list

### Of Wake-up Calls and Snooze Buttons ...

- Signals for change and action in various aspects of life (health, work, relationships)
- Can be a "loudest noise" to prompt reflection and change

**Reasons for Ignoring Wake-Up Calls**:
1. **False sense of invincibility**: Belief that it won't happen to us
2. **Hit-the-snooze-button syndrome**: Putting off action until later

**Consequences of Ignoring Wake-Up Calls**:
- Missed opportunities for positive change
- Increased risk of negative consequences (e.g., heart attack, bankruptcy, divorce)

**The "Snooze Button" Effect**:
- Tendency to delay action, underestimating the urgency of the call
- Can lead to a feeling that it can be put off indefinitely

**Breaking the "Snooze Button" Habit**:
- Get up immediately when the alarm rings or when hearing a wake-up call
- Don't give into the temptation to hit the snooze button (in various forms: physical, mental, emotional)
- Embrace the discomfort and take action towards positive change

**Benefits of Waking Up Immediately**:
- Better sleep and increased time in the morning
- Increased likelihood of taking action when critical wake-up calls occur

**The Second-Best Time to Do Anything**

**Regretting the Past**:
- Wishing you had done things differently
- Wishing you had cultivated certain habits as a child
- Wishing you had pursued certain activities (e.g., sports, relationships)
- Seeing change in the future tense (e.g., "I will do this after Diwali")

**The Power of Now**:
- The wisdom of the old Chinese proverb: "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now."
- The power of living in the present versus the futility of living in the past or dreaming of an imaginary future
- Success comes to those who live in the present and seize opportunities

**Do It Now**:
- If you want to do something, start today. Make a beginning.
- The future is uncertain, so make use of the "second-best time" - now.
- **It's never too late to become what you might have been.**

**Living in the Present**:
- If you knew you only had 6 months to live, what would you do?

- Audition for opportunities you're interested in

**The Real Lesson**:
- Do the things you want to do now, before it's too late.
- **Your time starts now.**
