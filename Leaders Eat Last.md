- Difference between leaders and managers: focus, culture, values, teamwork, trust, people orientation
- Importance of understanding the true purpose (Why) of an organization and its people

**The Role of Leaders:**
- Putting interests aside for the protection and growth of their teams
- Going first into danger or uncertainty
- Sacrificing own interests for their followers' safety
- Caring deeply about those they lead
- Placing needs of others above their own

**Leadership in Military Organizations:**
- U.S. Marine Corps as an example: strong culture, shared values, teamwork, trust, focus on people and relationships

- Leaders' willingness to place needs of others above their own

**Importance of Understanding Human Behavior:**
- Long-term organizational success depends on leadership excellence
- Creating an environment where people matter
- Sharing values and being valued: sustains organizations in good and bad times

**Quotes:**
- John Quincy Adams: "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."
- George J. Flynn: "When leaders inspire those they lead, people dream of a better future... They become leaders themselves."

### PART 1 OUR NEED TO FEEL SAFE. 1. Protection from Above

**Chapter 1: Our Need to Feel Safe**

- Captain flying an A-10 aircraft, providing close air support for the ground troops
- Waiting in the air, circling above the team
- Communicating with the ground team via radio

**The Decision to Descend**:
- Johnny Bravo sensed the troops' unease and uncertainty over the radio
- Believing he could provide assistance, he decided to perform a "weather letdown"
- This involved descending below the clouds to gain visual information on the ground situation

**The Risks**:
- Performing the weather letdown in the given conditions was extremely treacherous for even an experienced pilot

#### "Combat Aid: Pilot's Unflinching Response in Troubled Terrain"

### 2. Employees Are People Too

**Chapman's Approach to Leadership at HayssenSandiacre:**
- Bob Chapman, CEO of Barry-Wehmiller, took over HayssenSandiacre (a manufacturing company) as the latest acquisition
- Unlike other CEOs who may bring consultants and new strategies, Chapman brought a willingness to listen to employees
- He sat down with workers to hear their concerns and experiences

**Current Work Environment:**
- Employees followed a routine: wait for bell to start work, take breaks at scheduled times, machines run loud
- Little communication or connection between workers
- No sense of freedom or trust in management
- Workers were hesitant to speak openly with Chapman about their grievances for fear of repercussions

**Work Environment Prior to Chapman:**
- Employees had less freedom and more oversight
- Time clocks used for tracking work hours
- Lack of trust between workers and management.

**Employee Experiences:**
- Ron Campbell, a 27-year veteran, shared his experience working offsite in Puerto Rico where he felt more freedom than at HayssenSandiacre
- He felt restricted once back at the company due to time clock use and lack of trust from management.

#### "Earning Trust Through Empathetic Leadership"

**Factory Floor vs Office Workers:**
- Factory workers treated differently than office employees (Campbell)
- No trust: different policies for mundane tasks
- Two separate companies' feel

**Chapman's Changes:**
1. Removed time clocks and bells
2. Trusted employees with responsibility
3. Opened access to machine parts and company phones
4. Allowed free movement throughout the company
5. Treated all employees equally regardless of location or job title

**Impact of Changes:**
- Increased trust within the organization
- Company felt more like a family

**Chapman's Philosophy:**
1. Treat people as humans, not just workers
2. Extend trust to earn it
3. Belief in fundamental goodness of people
4. Change environment for different behaviors

#### "Building a Culture of Caring at HayssenSandiacre"

**Belonging and Relaxation at Work:**
- Employees felt valued: enabled them to relax
- Caring environment allowed for full engagement of "heads and hearts"
- Organization thrived

**Employee Support:**
- Crisis in paint department: employees donated vacation days
- Violated company policy, but trust prevailed
- Employees looked after each other and machines
- Fewer breakdowns, work stoppages, and expenses

**Company Growth:**
- Revenue increased from $55 million to $95 million
- Organic and acquisition growth without debt or management consultants
- People committed to the organization due to sense of pride

**The Transformation at HayssenSandiacre:**
- Five years after Chapman's acquisition: employees paid no attention to him
- First meeting with a cup of coffee

**Employee Support Story:**
- Employee in paint department faced personal crisis: wife losing leg, couldn't afford time off
- Colleagues transferred vacation days for support
- Violation of company policy, but trust prevailed
- People started to care for each other more

**Impact on Organization:**
- Fewer work stoppages and expenses
- Revenue growth: organic & acquisition
- Pride replaced obligation in work culture.

#### "Transformative Workplace Culture: From Rigidity to Camaraderie"

**Chapman's Experiment with HayssenSandiacre**

**Employees' Morning Routine**:
- Employees went about their business as usual
- In the cafeteria, they were joking and laughing like old friends
- They placed bets for the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament
- When they stood up to start their day, their demeanor changed dramatically
- Their smiles were replaced with sullenness, the laughing stopped, and the camaraderie evaporated
- Chapman felt a sense of despair, touched by what he had just witnessed

**Chapman's Realization**:
- He had been an effective executive based on data, market conditions, and financial goals
- But he had never seen the employees enjoying themselves at work like they did outside of work
- This spurred the thought: "Why can't we enjoy ourselves at work like we do when we're not at work?"

**Chapman's Previous Approach**:
- He was good with numbers and loved the game of business
- He made decisions based on data, market conditions, and financial opportunities
- He was tough when needed and could charm people to get what he wanted
- He saw people as one of the assets to help him achieve his financial goals

**Chapman's Shift in Perspective**:
- Before this realization, Chapman had been able to make hard decisions easily
- His company was close to bankruptcy when he took over after his father died in 1975
- He laid off employees, renegotiated debt obligations, and depended on banks for growth
- He took big risks to create growth that any high-flying executive would understand
- This slowly built the company back up to profitability

**Chapman's Meet-and-Greet with the Customer Service Team**:
- This was supposed to be a simple formality, but Chapman was unsure of what he would find

#### Creating a Thriving Workplace Culture through Biological Understanding

**Truly Human Leadership:**
- Chapman realized importance of creating an environment for honest expression and recognition
- Protects organization from internal rivalries, fostering trust and cooperation
- Based on biology and anthropology: systems designed to help us survive and thrive

**Impact of Work Environment:**
- High-performing organizations resemble conditions for human survival
- Safety among colleagues encourages trust, relaxation, and openness to cooperation
- Biological responses to danger or safety affect behavior in work setting

**Barry-Wehmiller:**
- Chapman accidentally created a work environment that brings out the best in people
- Focused on changing conditions, not employees
- Cultures inspiring people to give their all due to love for the workplace.

**Evolutionary Perspective:**
- Humans have become successful by responding to environments
- Decisions affect ability of other animals and humans to survive or thrive
- Survival systems influence behavior in work setting.

**Impact on Organization:**
- Cultures that inspire safety among employees lead to stronger organizations
- People working together achieve things beyond individual capabilities
- Result: towering over competitors.

#### The Power of Love and Empowerment in Leadership

**The Importance of Biological Systems in Modern Life:**
- Our primitive brains perceive world as threats or opportunities for safety (survival mode)
- Understanding these systems helps us achieve goals and create successful work environments
- Majority of companies today focus on short-term results, neglecting employee well-being

**The Impact of Unbalanced Priorities:**
- High levels of job dissatisfaction: Deloitte Shift Index (80%)
- Happiness and fulfillment at work should be a right, not a privilege

**Chapman's Transformation:**
- Series of small changes over time
- Focused on protecting employees as human beings

**The Awesome Responsibility:**
- Father's role in wedding ceremony symbolizes transferring care and responsibility
- Chapman realized the importance of putting employee well-being first.

#### The Power of Human-Centric Leadership

**The Relationship Between Leaders and Employees: A Parent-Child Connection**

**Understanding the Leader's Role:**
- Every employee is someone's son or daughter
- Leaders are responsible for their employees' wellbeing
  - Just as parents raise children, leaders build companies
  - Companies become an extended family

**The Importance of People in Business:**
- Capitalism thrives when people are fulfilled
- Treating people like family leads to loyalty and commitment
  - Employees defend the company like their own flesh and blood
  - Using company name as a symbol of identity

**Building Strong Organizations:**
- Prioritize people over numbers
  - Sacrifice performance for people, not vice versa
- Performance fuels growth for both organization and individuals

**Leadership Styles:**
- Leaders who prioritize people create high-performing companies
  - See money as a commodity to grow people
- Idealizing this approach is not unrealistic
  - Examples exist in various industries

**The Need for Change:**
- Only 20% of Americans enjoy their jobs
- Call to action: Build organizations that prioritize human beings' care and growth.

**Employee Responsibility:**
- Employees need courage to take care of each other when leaders don't
- Becoming the leaders we wish we had.

### 3. Belonging

**Belonging from "Me" to "We"**

**The Marine Corps Boot Camp Experience**:
- Recruits arrive at boot camp feeling tired and disoriented
- Greeted by red-faced drill instructors who assert their authority
- 13-week process of transforming recruits into Marines
- Goal is to replace "I, me, my" with "we, together, us"
- Recruits initially feel insecure and responsible for themselves
- Upon completion, feel confident in their own abilities and committed to fellow Marines
- This fosters trust, cooperation, and problem-solving

**The Circle of Safety**:
- Aesop's tale of the lion and the oxen: when they turned towards each other, the lion was unable to attack
- In Marine boot camp, recruits initially quarrel among themselves
- This weakens their collective strength and makes them vulnerable to external threats
- The true purpose of boot camp is to build a **Circle of Safety** - a sense of shared values and deep empathy
- This equips Marines to confront external dangers without fear of internal conflict

#### Creating a Culture of Belonging: Overcoming Internal Threats in Organizations

**The Importance of Teamwork for High-Performing Groups**

**Team Performance**:
- Not based on individual abilities or resources
- Hinges on how well team members pull together

**Dangers Facing Organizations**:
- External threats:
  - Economic factors (stock market, technology obsolescence)
  - Competition trying to frustrate success or steal customers
  - Urgent pressures to meet expectations
- Internal threats:
  - Layoffs following poor performance
  - Fear of losing livelihood by trying something new
  - Politics and intimidation in the organization
  - Feeling of being "dumb," "useless," or rejected

**Creating a Circle of Safety**:
- Leadership goal: Reduce threats people feel inside the group
- Provide sense of belonging and clear human values/beliefs
- Offer decision-making power, trust, and empathy
- Create an environment where people can focus on protecting the organization from external dangers

#### The Power of the Circle of Safety: Leadership for Unified Teams

**Company and Leadership**
- **People around us** determine where we invest energy
- Trusting people have our backs: unified team, better survival and thriving
- Spartans' strength came from shields, not weapons
- Shield symbolizes protection for the entire group
- Leader's role is to ensure safety of those inside their circle
- Letting someone in is like adopting a child, impacting sense of belonging
- Leaders establish standards for entry and maintain Circle of Safety

**Circle of Safety**
- Established by leaders as gatekeepers
- Extends to all members for shared responsibility
- Smaller organizations easier to manage as everyone knows each other
- As organization grows, trusting lower levels of management necessary
- Weak leaders only extend benefits to a chosen few, creating internal conflict

**Impact of Leadership**
- Impact on people's sense of belonging and willingness to contribute
- Protection from external threats and pressures
- Importance of extending the circle of safety to everyone in the organization.

#### Building a Circle of Safety for Organizational Success

**The Circle of Safety:**
- Prevents silos from forming and politics from entrenching
- Allows for clear standards and competent leadership
- Extends the organization's reach and capabilities

**Benefits of a Strong Circle of Safety:**
- Feeling valued and cared for by colleagues and superiors
- Confidence in leaders to help succeed
- Free exchange of information and effective communication
- Drives innovation, prevents problems from escalating
- Collaboration, trust, and cooperation result

**Importance of Trust within the Circle:**
- Can't force trust or cooperation
- Results from feeling safe and trusted among colleagues
- Leads to sharing ideas, intelligence, and burdens
- Amplifies skills and strengths for better competition and defense against external dangers

**The Role of Leaders:**
- Want to feel valued by their team members
- Importance of asking "Are you okay?" during difficult times
- Responsibility to express concern for leaders' well-being

**Maintaining a Strong Circle of Safety:**
- Feeling safe and trusted within the organization
- Collaboration, communication, and trust are essential components.

### 4. Yeah but . . .

**Chapter 4: Ken's Dilemma - Finding Happiness at Work**

**Ken's Situation**:
- Mid-level executive in operations for a multinational bank
- Doesn't love his job, but "it's fine"
- Feels responsible as a husband and father
- Dreams of quitting to do something else, but can't afford to

**Perceptions of Work**:
- Many people view work as a necessity rather than an ideal or source of happiness
- Companies prioritize profits over employees' well-being
- Reality of running a business makes it difficult to focus on employee safety and morale
- Pressure from Wall Street, corporate boards, competition, and the need to prove ROI are major obstacles

**Barry-Wehmiller Company**:
- An example of a company that prioritizes employee well-being
- Leaders understand the importance but struggle to implement it in practice

**Challenges for Individuals**:
- Difficulty finding jobs in companies that truly care about employees' well-being
- Fear of taking unnecessary risks or landing somewhere worse

**Conclusion**:
- The reality is that many organizations prioritize profits over people, making it challenging for individuals to find happiness and safety at work.

#### The Cost of Job Misery on Health and Business

**Cost of Decisions: Reality vs Perception**
* Costs to provide for our loved ones may come at the expense of our own joy, happiness, and fulfillment at work
* Perception of stability is often a "lie we tell ourselves" due to job insecurity
	+ Companies use layoffs to manage expenses, putting us at risk
	+ Meritocracy does not guarantee job security
	+ Depending on the company, annual reevaluations mean ongoing risk

**Health Impact of Unhappy Work**
* Having a job we hate can be as bad for our health as being unemployed
* High levels of depression and anxiety among unhappy workers
* Stress and anxiety at work linked to weak management and leadership
	+ Increased stress when leaders prioritize numbers over employees
* Lack of recognition for effort increases risk of heart disease

**Importance of Recognition in the Workplace**
* People who feel unrecognized for their efforts are more likely to suffer from heart disease
* Feeling valued and appreciated reduces stress levels and improves overall wellbeing
	+ Suffering from misery at work can be detrimental to both employees and companies.

#### "Whitehall Studies: Control, Stress, and Executive Health"

**Effects of Workplace Conditions on Employee Engagement (Gallup Poll "State of the American Workplace" 2013)**
- **Ignored by bosses**: 40% of employees actively disengage from work.
- **Criticized regularly**: 22% of employees actively disengage.
- **Rewarded for strengths**: only 1% of employees actively disengage when recognized and rewarded.
- **Happiness at work impacts coworkers**: unhappy employees can make others unhappy as well.

**Impact of Corporate Ladder on Stress (Whitehall Studies)**
- Decades-old studies in the UK:
  - Stress not caused by high responsibility and pressure but by lack of control.
  - Effort required not stressful, but imbalance between effort and reward causes stress.
  - Less control equals more stress.
- Findings profound and astounding as they controlled for healthcare variances.

**Modern Study on Stress Levels (Harvard and Stanford Researchers, 2012)**
- Leaders have lower stress levels than those who work for them.
- Feeling in charge of one's life outweighs the additional responsibility at higher rungs on the corporate ladder.

#### "Workplace Stress: Impact on Health & Productivity"

**Findings from Whitehall Studies**
- Lower rank in organizational hierarchy correlated with greater risk of stress-related health problems
- Senior executives had longer, healthier lives than clerks and managers
- Report by public health researchers at UCL found workers lowest in hierarchy had early death rate 4 times higher than those at top
- Jobs with less control linked to higher rates of mental illness
- Similar findings in non-human primates: lower hierarchical position associated with higher disease, stress hormones

**Implications for Control and Work Environment**
- Sense of control over work and life crucial for stress reduction and optimal performance
- Supportive, well-managed environments good for health; feeling empowered reduces stress
- Feeling unsafe at work violates natural laws and harms our design as social beings
- Even with data on negative effects, many stay in unhappy jobs
- Mercer LLC report: one in three employees seriously considered leaving jobs but less than 1.5 percent actually did so.

#### "Promoting Well-being at Work: Building Circles of Safety"

**The Problem with Unhealthy Work Environments**
- One-third of employees want to leave their jobs but don't
- People feel stuck in unhealthy work environments
- Reasons for staying: feeling of "devil-you-know" or lack of alternatives

**Alternative Route: Changing How We Approach Work**
- Staying at current job, not quitting
- Shift focus from self to colleagues
- Protect and support each other, like the Spartans

**Business Implications**
- Leaders should treat people well during hard times to prevent mass exodus
- In good economy, treating people well prevents turnover when times are tough again
- Cost-effective for companies in terms of performance and employee health

**Impact on Families**
- Child's sense of well-being affected less by parent's work hours than mood upon return home
- Late nights at work or frequent business trips not the problem, but parents' happiness is

**The Price We Pay for Neglecting Well-being**
- Not providing a healthy work environment can harm children
- Leaders who prioritize cost over people create a ripple effect of issues

**Solution: Building Circles of Safety at Work**
- Pulling together and taking action, not just pointing fingers
- Harness the powerful forces within us to solve the problem.

### PART 2 POWERFUL FORCES. 5. When Enough Was Enough

**Chapter 5: Human Evolution and Survival Instincts**

**Paleolithic Times:**
- Extremely dangerous living conditions
- No heating, air conditioning, supermarkets, hospitals, or jobs
- Focus on survival rather than education or opportunities

**Early Humans:**
- First steps out in the world around 50,000 years ago
- Originally dirt poor with limited resources
- Survival was a priority over modern advancements

**Homo Sapiens:**
- Intelligent and capable species
- Similar to modern humans in appearance and intellect
- Designed for cooperation and survival through tough times

**Biology and Anthropology:**
- Humans are at their best when facing danger together
- Belonging to a group builds trust and cooperation
- Investing time in self-protection can make us vulnerable to external threats

**Leadership and Motivation:**
- Creating internal pressure or urgency is not effective for motivation
- Trust and belonging foster cooperation to face challenges
- Feeling safe with colleagues increases chances of survival and success.

#### The Evolutionary Advantage of Human Cooperation

**Homo Sapiens' Adaptation for Survival:**
* Complex neocortex: problem-solving brain, sophisticated communication (syntax and grammar)
* Social species: cooperative behavior essential for survival
	+ Dependence on others for help and protection
	+ Populations thrived due to cooperation
* Ancestral environment vs. modern world: old-fashioned living in a resource-rich society
* Genetic coding remains the same, but challenges arise with modernization

**The Importance of Cooperation:**
* Humans are highly social species
* Survival depends on helping each other
	+ Raising young, caring for sick and elderly
	+ Protecting group members from external threats
* Mutual aid is essential for group's survival and success
* Conflict exists in any group but ultimately leads to unity in defense of the community
* Cooperation works regardless of culture or unique hardships.

#### The Biological Basis of Social Cohesion and Reward Systems

**The Importance of Social Interaction**

**Social Animals**:
- We are social animals, just as much today as thousands of years ago
- Social interaction was significant for building and maintaining trust
- Forming bonds of trust through getting to know each other

**Importance of Social Interaction in the Workplace**:
- Eating together and doing things as a family matters
- Company picnics, conferences, and time around the watercooler are important
- The more familiar we are with each other, the stronger our bonds
- Social interaction is also important for leaders of an organization

**The Dorm Room Experience**:
- College dorms mimic ancestral kinship societies
- Leaving doors open and socializing in the hallway
- Bonds of friendship formed in the dorm rooms are vital

**Our Biological Makeup**:
- Our success as a species was not by chance, but earned through hard work and collaboration
- We are **social machines**, built to work together
- Our bodies reward us for helping each other

**The Chemical Dependency of Happiness**:
- Evolution has tuned our physiology for a reason
- Taste buds help our digestive systems process food
- Eyebrows channel sweat away from our eyes
- Everything about our bodies was designed to help us survive
- The feelings of happiness are also conditioned, just like rewards and punishments in the workplace

#### The Conflict Between Self-Preservation and Social Cohesion in Human Evolution

**The Chemistry of Happiness**

**Positive Feeling and Biology**:
- The body uses positive feelings (happiness, pride, joy) to promote behaviors for survival
- Rewards for working to keep oneself and others alive are chemical, not monetary

**Chemicals Contributing to Positive Feelings**:
- **Endorphins**, **dopamine**, **serotonin**, and **oxytocin** contribute to positive feelings
- These chemicals serve a practical purpose: survival

**Tension between Individual and Collective Interests**:
- We must weigh personal benefits against benefits to the group
- Decisions can hurt either ourselves or the group
- This tension is inherent in being human

**The Paradox of Being Human**:
- We are individuals and members of groups at all times
- Both putting self first and putting group first are necessary

**Chemicals for Individual Survival**:
- **Endorphins** and **dopamine** help us persevere, find food, and get things done
- These are the "selfish" chemicals

**Chemicals for Socialization and Cooperation**:
- **Serotonin** and **oxytocin** incentivize working together and developing trust/loyalty
- These are the "selfless" chemicals

### 6. E.D.S.O.

**E.D.S.O.W with Out Se l f ish Chemicals: We Would Starve to Death**

**Supermarket Behavior**:
- We shouldn't go shopping when hungry, as we buy too much and unnecessary items
- Ancestors faced scarcity and had to hunt/gather regularly for survival

**Endorphins and Dopamine**:
- Chemicals that drive us to hunt, gather, and achieve
- Make us feel good when finding something desired or accomplishing goals
- **Endorphins**: Mask physical pain with pleasure, like a "runner's high"
- **Dopamine**: Drives motivation and reward, enhances learning and memory

**Endorphin's Purpose**:
- To mask physical pain, providing an edge for hunting and survival
- Humans have remarkable physical endurance due to endorphins
- Encourages us to keep going during long hunts, increasing chances of success

**Endorphin Addiction**:
- Regular exercisers may crave the endorphin "high" from hard workouts
- Helps them cope with stress and relax after a long day at work

#### The Role of Dopamine in Achievement and Progress

**The Role of Dopamine in Achieving Progress**

**Ancestors' Motivations**:
- Ancestors went hunting and gathering not just out of necessity, but because it felt good
- The human body rewards activities like food search and shelter building with endorphins

**Modern Life**:
- With readily available resources, the body no longer gets endorphin rewards from food search
- Endorphins are now mainly released during exercise or manual labor

**Laughter and Endorphins**:
- Laughter releases endorphins to mask pain, providing a "high" that reduces fear and tension
- Lightheartedness can help relax and focus during tense times

**Dopamine's Role in Progress**:
- **Dopamine** is the reason for the good feeling when we find what we're looking for or complete tasks
- Dopamine provides motivation to stay focused on tasks, like hunting and gathering, that ensure survival
- It helps us become a goal-oriented species, biased towards progress

#### Visual Goals and Dopamine Rewards: The Science Behind Setting Achievable Objectives

**The Importance of Setting Tangible Goals**

**Dopamine's Role**:
- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps motivate and reward progress towards goals
- As we make progress towards a goal, we get "little hits" of dopamine that keep us going
- The bigger the goal, the more dopamine we get upon reaching it

**The Importance of Visualizing Goals**:
- We are visually oriented animals and trust our eyes more than other senses
- Seeing or imagining a clear goal increases the likelihood of accomplishing it
- Having specific, measurable goals is more motivating than vague or amorphous ones

**The Significance of Milestones**:
- As we reach each milestone towards a goal, we get a "little hit" of dopamine
- This helps keep us going and working harder to reach the final reward

#### Dopamine and Social Media Addiction: Understanding the Connection

**The Importance of Clear Vision Statements**

**Importance of Measuring Progress**:
- Unable to adequately measure progress, cannot determine if we are making worthwhile progress
- Visions of being "the biggest" or "the best" are useless in inspiring hard work

**Effective Vision Statements**:
- Explain what the world would look like if all efforts were wildly successful
- Provide a clear picture to inspire and guide action
- Examples: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech

**Benefits of Clear Vision Statements**:
- Clarify goals and objectives
- Inspire progress towards something bigger than ourselves
- Improve focus, productivity, and collaboration

**Dopamine and Motivation**:
- Dopamine is associated with feeling good, motivation, and addiction
- Can lead to neural connections that enhance or hinder survival

**Potential Addictions**:
- Cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, gambling, social media all release dopamine
- Neural connections formed around the "ding, buzz, or flash" of notifications
- Can lead to constant checking and distraction from important tasks

#### The Role of Dopamine and Endorphins in Social Cohesion

**The Role of Dopamine and Endorphins in Motivation**

**Dopamine**:
- Craving a "hit" of chemical feel-good
- Addictive behaviors, such as:
    - Alcoholism
    - Gambling
    - Checking phone/social media first thing in the morning
- Performance-driven organizations use dopamine as primary means of reward
- Can lead to addiction and high costs
- Fueled by prehistoric foraging desires

**Endorphins**:
- Work together with dopamine to ensure survival (food, shelter)
- Provide energy and edge to keep going, even when tired/exhausted
- Reward with a chemical rush upon accomplishment

**Selfless Chemicals**:
- Make us feel valued in the company of trusted others
- Give a sense of belonging
- Inspire us to work for the good of the group

**Together is Better**:
- Progress and achievement are core to doing well in a dangerous world
- Selfless chemicals keep the "Circle of Safety" strong.

#### The Role of Serotonin and Oxytocin in Social Bonding and Leadership

**Crocodiles vs. Humans:**
- **Instinctual Behavior**: Crocodiles act out of instinct when competing for food
- **Reptilian Brain**: Primitive portion shared with humans, but crocodiles are solitary animals
- **Mammalian Brain**: Humans possess a layer that enables social behavior and cooperation

**Human Sociality:**
- **Adaptation**: Necessary for survival due to lack of protective features
- **Importance of Serotonin and Oxytocin**: Encourage pro-social behavior, form bonds of trust and friendship

**Impact on Humans:**

- **Stress Reduction**: Declines when social incentives are present
- **Leadership**: Inspiring leaders, loyal followers, close friends, trusted partners
- **Absence of Commitment**: Decreases desire to help colleagues and organization.

**Impact on Crocodiles:**
- **Lack of Sociality**: No incentives for cooperation or forming bonds.

#### The Impact of Serotonin on Self-Worth and Career Success

**Vicious Cycle of Leadership and Team Cohesion:**
* Lack of support from colleagues and leaders leads to individual selfishness
* Selfishness results in less looking out for each other, further exacerbating the problem
* Organizational success suffers due to lack of strong culture and social connections

**Oxytocin and Serotonin:**
* These chemicals "grease the social machine"
* Missing conditions inhibit release, causing friction in relationships

**Serotonin: The Pride Chemical**
* Creates feelings of confidence and respect
* Increases perceived status within group
* Importance to social animals for approval and validation

**Impact on Individuals:**
* Sally Field's example: Oscars boost career opportunities and confidence (serotonin)
* Graduates feel a sense of pride, increased confidence, and higher status with diplomas.

- Human presence during an achievement enhances the experience
  - Spectators cheering at a finish line
  - Family and friends supporting an individual's efforts

**Serotonin and Personal Growth**:
- Knowing others believe in our abilities drives us to push ourselves further
- The desire to make those who support us proud
- Giving support to others also creates a sense of responsibility and accountability

**Group Dynamics**:
- Serotonin helps build group cohesion and respect
  - Higher status in the group leads to more incentive to give back
  - Recognition and respect from the group increases our self-worth.

#### "The Role of Oxytocin in Building Trust and Social Bonds"

**The Role of Serotonin and Oxytocin in Social Interactions**

**Serotonin**:
- Encourages individuals to serve those for whom they are responsible
- Helps employees work hard to make their supervisors proud
- Leads to the feeling of being the "alpha" or strong, supportive member of a group

**Oxytocin**:
- Responsible for feelings of friendship, love, and deep trust
- Vital for survival instincts as it enables acts of generosity and empathy
- Necessary for developing strong bonds of trust and friendship
- Allows individuals to rely on others to watch their backs
- Directs how vulnerable we can afford to make ourselves in social interactions
- Long-lasting compared to dopamine, leading to more stable relationships.

#### The Power and Benefits of Random Acts of Kindness

**The Power of Love and Belonging**

**Definition of Love**:
- Giving someone the power to destroy us and trusting they won't use it

**Building Trust and Relationships**:
- Trust takes time and energy
- Trust is needed to feel like we belong
- Our brains are wired for oxytocin release when in presence of tribe
- Sense of belonging confers a sense of safety

**The Importance of Belonging**:
- We are herd animals, biologically designed to find comfort in groups
- Being on the periphery is dangerous, being safely surrounded and valued is essential

**Building Trust through Small Acts of Kindness**:
- Helping someone in need can release oxytocin for both parties
- Witnessing acts of generosity inspires us to do the same

#### The Magic of Oxytocin: Building Trust and Encouraging Altruism

**Oxytocin and Its Impact on Human Interactions**

**Oxytocin's Role in Selfless Acts and Trust:**
- Inspires good deeds: oxytocin makes us feel like we can do more for others, leading to a chain reaction of positive actions (Mother Nature's way of preserving the genes)
- Powerful bonding hormone: releases during selfless acts, creating feelings of trust and loyalty between individuals

**Effects of Oxytocin on Human Interactions:**
- Enhances social bonds: responsible for reinforcing relationships among athletes, families, or partners (high-fives, handshakes)
- Trust signals: refusal to shake hands can impact trust levels in business deals
- Longer lifespan: happiness increases life expectancy by 35% according to a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2011

**Oxytocin's Benefits:**
- Boosts immune system: enhances overall health and resistance to addictions (dopamine)
- Problem solver: makes us better at solving issues arising from daily life challenges.
- Calm feelings: provides lasting feelings of safety and contentment, reducing the need for instant gratification.

### 7. The Big C

**Chapter 7: The Importance of Group Living**

**Scenario:**
- Warm, sunny day with a calm breeze
- Gazelles grazing peacefully
- Sudden shattering of calm: potential threat detected

**Gazelle's Response:**
1. One gazelle senses danger and alerts the herd
2. All gazelles stop grazing and look up
3. Entire group joins in to search for threat
4. One alerted gazelle makes a mad dash, signaling danger
5. The whole herd follows, running for their lives
6. Lion gives chase but eventually tires
7. Reaction ensures greater opportunity for herd survival

**Benefits of Group Living:**
- Early warning system: one member's alertness protects all
- Increased chances of spotting potential threats
- Survival advantage through collective action

**Natural Early Warning System:**
- Sense something is wrong = natural instinct
- Designed to alert us to threats and prepare for danger

**Cortisol's Role:**
- Chemical responsible for stress and anxiety
- Triggers "gut feeling" or sense of danger
- Helps the body respond to potential threats.

#### Understanding Cortisol: The Office-Savanna Connection

**The Role of Cortisol in our Stress Response**

**Cortisol as a Survival Mechanism**:
- Alerts us to possible danger
- Prepares us to take extra measures to protect ourselves
- Raises our chances of survival

**Spreading of Rumors and Anxiety**:
- Example: Layoffs in an office scenario
- Cortisol is released, causing a heightened sense of alertness and anxiety
- Distracts employees from getting other work done until the threat is perceived to pass

**Adrenaline Response to Threat**:
- Provides energy to get away or boost strength to face the foe
- Can lead to "superhuman" strength in certain situations

**Cortisol and Paranoia**:
- Cortisol tries to help us find and prepare for the threat
- This can lead to paranoid thoughts and blame towards others

**Impact of Chronic Stress**:
- Cortisol is not supposed to stay in our system
- Prolonged stress can cause lasting damage to our internal systems

#### The Impact of Office Culture on Stress and Empathy

**The Problem with Modern Work Environments:**

**Lack of Support and Cooperation:**
- People prefer to keep to themselves at work
- Resistance to helping others
- Constant low-grade anxiety due to lack of support

**Effect on Employees:**

- Perception that colleagues only care about themselves
- Fear of bosses, layoffs, and negative consequences
- Lack of trust and weak bonds between employees

**Impact on Productivity and Morale:**
- Constant competition and self-focused behavior
- Inhibition of empathy due to cortisol inhibiting oxytocin release
- Potential for increased selfishness and disengagement from the organization.

#### The Impact of Workplace Stress on Health and Immune System

**Effects of Unhealthy Work Culture**
- Adapting to unhealthy work culture similar to adapting to dangerous mountain conditions
- Human body not built for prolonged exposure to unhealthy work environments
- Effects on health:
  - **Cortisol**: constant flow leads to serious damage
    - Increases blood pressure, inflammatory responses, and impairs cognitive ability
    - Suppresses sex drive and increases aggression
    - Wreaks havoc with glucose metabolism
    - Prepares body for sudden reaction, turning off immune system during stress bursts
  - Long-term exposure to cortisol leads to vulnerability to illness
  - Conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer more likely to kill than violent crime or terrorism.
- Modern world sees high rates of preventable diseases due to unhealthy work environments.
- Organization leaders should take responsibility for the impact on employees' health.

### 8. Why We Have Leaders

**Why We Have Leaders**

**Anthropological Perspective on Leadership**:
- Reveals standards for good and bad leaders
- Linked to food and protection
- Human beings are hierarchical animals

**Evolution of Hierarchy**:
- Avoided fighting and pushing for food
- Dominant individuals allowed others to eat first
- Serotonin levels increased, signaling status rise

**Advantages of Hierarchy**:
- Alpha's first choice of mate and meat
- Rest of tribe got to eat eventually
- Reduced conflicts and promoted cooperation

#### Social Status and its Influence on Self-Esteem and Happiness

**Societal Preferences for Alphas**

**Advantages of Alpha Individuals:**
- Receive preferential treatment based on their ranking in society
- Make more money than others at work
- Obtain better office spaces or parking spots
- Access to hard-to-get-into restaurants and other exclusive venues
- Accumulate attractive partners

**Acceptance of Alpha Advantages:**
- Comfortable with leaders getting preferential treatment
- Upset or offended when alphas don't receive expected advantages
- Volunteer to carry luggage for leaders as an act of respect and honor

**Improving One's Place in the Pecking Order:**
- Primping and puffing up appearance to increase perceived attractiveness and strength
- Talk about accomplishments to gain respect from others
- Display symbols of success, such as diplomas or trophies

**The Desire for Status:**
- Raise status in community through recognition of intelligence, strength, and worthiness
- Serotonin release associated with increased status and confidence

**Conspicuous Displays of Wealth:**
- Indicate success and capacity to others
- Boost position in the social hierarchy

**Faking Status:**
- Ineffective at tricking biology into feeling genuine pride or status
- Creating a false sense of accomplishment may lead to feelings of phoniness and cheating.

#### The Cost of Leadership: Alpha's Duty and Social Contract

**The Biological Basis of Status**
- **Status is biological**: must be earned to feel it
- Those who attempt to cheat their biology are more inclined to cheat in other aspects of their lives as well
- Raising status with material goods doesn't provide a lasting sense of pride
- Lack of social relationship associated with bursts of serotonin

**The Importance of Relationships for Pride and Leadership**
- **Selfless chemicals** try to help us strengthen communities and social bonds
- Lasting sense of pride requires a mentor/parent/boss/coach/leader relationship
- **Leadership status**: not just for people, also offered to tribes
- Companies constantly try to raise their status in their respective industries
- Rankings are loved because we're hierarchical animals and there are perks to being higher in the pecking order

**The Cost of Leadership**
- All advantages of leadership do not come for free
- **Leadership requires self-interest**: alpha may be "stronger" and better fed, oozing confidence from serotonin
- Leaders are expected to rush toward danger to protect the rest of us
- The cost of leadership is steep: we expect leaders to offer protection in return for perks
- Offended when leaders don't uphold this social contract, as they violate the definition of what it means to be a leader

#### Leadership: Sacrifice and Selflessness as Cornerstones

**Leadership and Social Contract**

**Sacrifices for the Greater Good**:
- Leaders are willing to make sacrifices for the benefit of those they lead
- They consider the well-being of others before themselves, sometimes suffering as a result
- This earns them respect and trust from their followers

**Reputation and Social Contract**:
- Companies build reputation by being willing to do the right thing for their people and customers/clients
- Breaking this social contract of leadership results in a negative reputation

**Celebrities and Wealth**:
- Celebrities and the wealthy are sometimes afforded privileges due to their perceived higher status
- This is not true alpha status, as it lacks the personal sacrifices for others
- Public figures may engage in charitable work to uphold the appearance of maintaining the social contract

**Politicians and Leadership**:
- Politicians may make campaign promises based on caring for their constituents
- True leadership involves serving others, even when it requires sacrificing personal comfort
- Trust is not just about shared opinions, but a belief that someone has one's well-being at heart

#### Leaders: Sacrificing for the Greater Good

**The Role of a Leader: Sacrifice for the Tribe**

**Leaders Sacrifice**:
- Leaders are willing to give up their own resources (time, energy, money) for those they lead
- They "eat last" and prioritize the needs of their tribe
- True leaders are those who accept this responsibility to protect and support their people

**Weak Leaders vs. True Leaders**:
- Weak leaders aim for alpha status and personal gain without fulfilling leadership responsibilities
- True leaders rise through the ranks due to their willingness to sacrifice for their tribe
- Even good leaders can become selfish and power-hungry, but they can regain footing if they remember who they serve

**The Circle of Safety**:
- Leaders create a sense of protection and support for those in their care
- Followers are willing to offer "blood, sweat, and tears" to help the leader's vision come to life
- The leader's role is simply to remember who they serve, and the followers will support them in return

**The Ceramic Cup**:
- A story of a former Under Secretary reflecting on his leadership journey

- Rejected the notion of sacking employees
- Viewed company as family, not just labor force
- Belief in suffering together during hard times

**Implementation of Mandatory Furlough Program**
- Four weeks of unpaid time off for all employees (CEO to secretary)
- Employees could take the weeks off whenever they wanted
- Non-consecutively.

**Chapman's Announcement and Impact**

* Safety ensures innovation and progress

**The Role of Feel-Good Chemicals:**
* Essential for individual and population survival
* Endorphins: Hard labor, muscle through tough times
* Dopamine: Goal setting, focus, making progress
* Serotonin: Pride in achievements of self or loved ones
* Oxytocin: Forms strong bonds of love and trust
* Keeps us healthy, opens minds, improves problem-solving abilities.

#### Finding Balance in Leadership: Chemistry of Motivation

**The Combined Problem-Solving Ability of Trusted People**

**Leaps of Greatness**:
- Require the combined problem-solving ability of people who trust each other
- Not a perfect system:
    - Chemicals do not fire evenly or in strict allotments
    - Can be released together or in varying amounts
    - Can be short-circuited for the wrong reasons

**Selfish vs. Selfless Chemicals**:
- **Endorphins and dopamine**: Provide short-term rewards, can lead to addiction
- **Serotonin and oxytocin**: Take time to build up, provide long-term benefits

**Motivation and Goals**:
- We cannot directly motivate others
- Motivation is determined by the chemicals within us
- Motivated by desire to repeat good behaviors or avoid stress/pain
- Environments that release the right chemicals for the right reasons create self-motivated people

**Balancing Chemicals**:
- Dopamine-driven: Achievement, but can lead to loneliness and unfulfillment
- Oxytocin-driven: Love/friendship, but lacks sense of accomplishment
- Balance: Gives courage, inspiration, foresight, creativity, and empathy

### PART 3 REALITY. 9. The Courage to Do the Right Thing

**Chapter 9: The Courage to Do the Right Thing**

**Smoke Emergency on Flight KH209**
- Air traffic controller asked about number of souls on board (126)
- Smoke in cockpit, pilot unsure of cause or extent of emergency
- FAA rules prohibit passing other aircraft within 1,000 feet or five miles
- Two planes heading to Florida, one flying at 34,000 ft and the other at 2,000 ft below

**Emergency Situation**
- Smoke in cockpit: terrifying emergency for pilots
- Difficulty seeing or breathing, panic among passengers
- Pilot unable to maintain altitude, requests immediate descent

**Air Traffic Controller's Response**
- Orders pilot to turn fifteen degrees right and descend
- Direction enters restricted airspace, within 2 miles of other aircraft

**Implications of Controller's Instructions**
- Potential collision with another plane (within 1,000 feet)
- Collision alarm would sound for both planes
- Experienced air traffic controller aware of all aircraft and rules.

- Repeated message to pilots about an aircraft in distress descending through their altitude
- 126 souls saved as troubled vessel passed through multiple aircraft's airspace

**Trust and Rules**:
- Trust is not just about obeying rules, but knowing when to break them
- Rules are for normal operations and avoiding danger
- Expertise of a few trusted individuals to know when to deviate from the rules

**Organizational Training**:
- Organizations offer opportunities for self-improvement and greater responsibility
- More training leads to confidence, trust, and ability to handle emergencies

**Trust vs. Rules/Technology**:
- Trust is a human experience produced by oxytocin in response to safety and protection
- Technology or rulebooks cannot truly trust us or care about us as people
- Breaking rules requires active concern for safety, which cannot be replicated by technology or rules.

#### Shared Trust: The Key to Successful Leadership

**Relationship Dynamics:**
- Bureaucrats may appear infuriating due to disregard for people and rules (default to rules without consideration)
- Importance of shared trust in relationships for benefits: one-way trust is not beneficial
- Leaders' role: teach, train, build confidence, then step back and trust their people
- Weak organizations vs strong organizations:
  * In weak organizations, people break rules for personal gain (lack of oversight)
  * In strong organizations, people break rules to do the right thing (confidence from leaders)

**Trust:**
- Trust is fundamental for successful relationships between people and companies
- Trust in rules vs trust in people: preference lies with trusting people
- Leaders' responsibility: provide cover, encourage confidence, allow rule-breaking when necessary.

**Organizational Culture:**
- Bad culture: fear of following rules instead of doing what's right
- Souls will be lost if good people work in a bad culture where leaders don't relinquish control.

- Short-circuits our system to focus on self-interest

**Trust and Commitment**:
- Essential for deep connections and organizational success
- Hard to measure or create artificially with incentives
- Require time, energy, and genuine will from leaders and team members

**Building Trust**:
- Leaders must understand that people are not the problem
- The environment in which people operate is crucial
- Trust is like lubrication that reduces friction and fosters performance

**Conclusion**:
- Not about how smart people are, but how well they work together
- Requires commitment from leaders to create an environment of trust and commitment.

* Three significant stock market crashes when leaders prioritize self-interest first.

#### "The Impact of Imbalanced Chemicals on Society and Economy"

**Impact of Imbalances in Society and Markets:**
* Stock market crashes: corrective measures needed to prevent imbalance (1987, 2000, 2008)
* Historical context: lack of resources leads to sharing and cooperation; modern society's disconnection from natural inclinations due to abundance and individualism.
* Impacts on health, economy, companies, and potentially other aspects of life.
* Imbalance in chemical rewards: dopamine vs serotonin/oxytocin (individual achievement vs working together).
* Societal system rewards individual performance at expense of collaboration and trust building.
* Imbalanced corporate cultures lead to instability (Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Lehman Brothers).
* Lack of effort to change the system creates greater imbalance and risk for society.

**Impact on Human Interactions:**

#### Abstracting Humanity in Modern Business: The Challenges of Distance and Scale

**The Problem with Modern Business: Lack of Empathy and Humanity**

**Blaming**:
- We can't blame an entire generation for the current issues
- Nor can we blame the industry, specific CEOs or "the corporations"
- There aren't "comic book–style archenemies running companies"

**The Issue**:
- Lack of **empathy and humanity** in how we do business today
- Smart executives managing systems, but lack of strong **leaders to lead the people**
- We don't wake up hoping someone will **manage us**, we want someone to **lead us**

**Humanization of Work**:
- **Deglobalization** and rehumanizing work is needed
- Abundance can short-circuit our systems and damage organizations
- Abundance abstracts the value of things, leading to devaluation of relationships

**The Scale of Modern Business**:
- Scale can create distance, abstracting human concepts
- Consumers become abstractions, just "people who will consume"
- Technology amplifies this abstraction, making it harder to see each other as human

**Consequences of Abstraction**:
- Abstraction can be destructive to the economy and deadly
- We are working and living in a world where we are **strangers to those around us**
- The human being has gone "virtual", existing only as abstract representations

### PART 5 THE ABSTRACT CHALLENGE. 13. Abstraction Kills

**Chapter 13 Abstract**
- **Eichmann's Escape and Capture**
  * Living a normal life in Argentina under false identity for fifteen years (1946-1960)

  * Brought back to face trial in Jerusalem
- **The Holocaust's Unfolding**
  * Nuremberg Trials: Charges against twenty-four senior Nazis for crimes against humanity
  * Eichmann absent due to successful escape
- **The Role of Adolf Eichmann**
  * Organized logistics for rounding up and deportation of Jews and others to ghettos and concentration camps (1939-1945)
  * Significant role in Holocaust, oversaw process that sent innocent people to death camps
- **Reactions and Debate**
  * Collective intent: Entire population abandoned humanity and morality for genocide to happen on such a scale
  * Ordinary Germans turning a blind eye involved at different levels: soldiers committing crimes, millions willfully ignoring.

#### "Milgram's Obedience Experiment: Understanding Authority Compliance"

**Milgram's Experiment on Obedience to Authority**

**Background:**
- Stanley Milgram, Yale psychologist, wanted to understand human obedience to authority
- Designed an experiment after Adolf Eichmann's trial in 1961
- Investigated our willingness to obey orders despite moral concerns

**Experiment Setup:**
- Two volunteers: teacher and student (actually another scientist)
- Teacher sat at a console with electric shock switches
- Students told they would receive mild shocks if they answered incorrectly or refused to answer
- Switches labeled with increasing voltages, ranging from "Slight Shock" to "Extreme Intensity Shock"

**Experiment Process:**
- Teachers given the responsibility of administering electric shocks to students for wrong answers
- Milgram aimed to understand human obedience on a mass scale.

#### The Stanford Prison Experiment: Obedience to Authority and Human Nature's Dark Side

**The Experiment**
- **160 volunteers**: put through experiment with 4 variations
- **Variations**:
    - Scientist played role of student, teacher had to physically place hand on shock plate
    - Student in room with teacher, teacher could see and hear reactions
    - Student in separate room, teacher could only hear student's protests and screams
    - Student out of sight and sound, teacher could only hear "thumping"
- **Teacher**: hears student pretending to express discomfort, then shouting and pleading to end the experiment

**Results**
- Volunteers expressed concern as they realized they were causing pain
- Asked if they should continue, received responses:
    - "Please continue."
    - "The experiment requires that you continue."
    - "It is absolutely essential that you continue."
    - "You have no other choice, you must go on."
- Volunteers became nervous, some started sweating and shaking
- Most continued despite discomfort

**Predictions vs. Reality**
- Scientists predicted 2-3% would go far with minimal empathy
- Actual results were **horrifying**:
    - With physical placement: **70%** quit early
    - In same room, no physical contact: **60%** refused to continue
    - Couldn't see or hear student: **35%** continued

#### "The Milgram Experiment: Abstracting Humanity and its Ethical Implications"

**Experiment Findings:**
- Majority of volunteers (65%) went through entire experiment, expressing concern but not considering own culpability or student's well-being
- Criticized for ethical concerns
- Volunteers showed remorse after conclusion and felt personal responsibility
- Some blamed scientists; others transferred blame to the student
- Higher moral imperatives led some volunteers to refuse participation when they realized they were causing pain
- Abstraction from reality can lead to inhumane behavior, as seen in Milgram's experiment and modern workplace practices.

**Milgram's Experiment:**
- Volunteers expressed concern but did not consider their own responsibility or student's well-being during the experiment
- Debriefing revealed no harm was caused, some volunteers felt remorse later on
- Some blamed scientists for instructions and responsibilities; others transferred blame to the student
- Volunteers who refused participation felt accountable to a higher moral authority

**Impact of Abstraction:**
- Physical separation from workers or customers can result in dramatic impacts on lives
- Numerical abstraction can lead to abstracting people from humanity and cause inhumane behavior
- Companies' growth leads to larger physical distance, making it easier to make decisions without considering the human impact.

### 14. Modern Abstraction

**Modern Absurdity: The Peanut Corporation of America Scandal (2009)**
* **Background:**
  * Salmonella outbreak in 2009 kills nine people, sickens over seven hundred
  * Outbreak traced to products from the Peanut Corporation of America (PCA)
* **Company Culture and Leadership:**
  * President Stewart Parnell's disregard for safety: e-mail complaining about costs and delays in shipping peanuts despite positive tests
  * Pressure on employees to meet targets
* **Consequences:**
  * Criminal charges against Mr. Parnell and team (2013)
  * Company went out of business in 2009
* **Implications:**
  * Disconnect between leaders and those they serve
  * Prioritization of metrics over lives
  * Impact on relationships: self-preservation becomes primary focus
* **Command and Control Culture:**
  * Milgram's experiments: 65% of people capable of harming others when impact is abstract
  * Fear of consequences, such as getting in trouble or losing jobs, drives decisions
* **Modern Mantras:**
  * Defenses used to avoid accountability for harmful decisions.

#### Business Ethics: The Pursuit of Profit Over Morality

**Impact of Corporate Responsibility on Business Practices:**
* Argument between author and investment banker about corporate responsibility
* Banker defended actions as not his responsibility or job
* Fear for personal safety can lead to self-preservation instead of accountability
* Milgram's experiment: obedience to authority over moral responsibility
* Companies prioritize profits within the law, ignoring moral obligations
* Apple Inc.'s tax evasion strategy: using Irish subsidiaries and Netherlands to avoid US taxes
	+ Keeping profits out of reach of tax authorities (over $74 billion)
	+ No denial from Apple but not breaking any rules according to Friedman's perspective.

**Milton Friedman's View on Business Responsibility:**
* One social responsibility: increase profits within the rules of the game
* Rules referring to law, imperfect with loopholes
* Companies follow letter of the law over moral responsibilities
* Obedience to scientist instead of higher moral authority in Milgram's experiment.

**Impact on Society:**
* Some corporations prioritize profits over societal obligations
* Adherence to tax laws may not equal ethical business practices
* Wealth redistribution through tax avoidance strategies.

#### The Obligation of Corporate Responsibility: A Historical Perspective

**The Importance of Trust:**
* Humans have an absolute need to form bonds of trust for survival
* Our primitive brain evaluates words and behaviors of individuals and companies
* Trust is essential on a biological and social level

**Evaluating Trustworthiness:**
* Biologically, trust is universal
* Morality and sense of right or wrong matter socially
* Companies' actions can impact our trust despite the law

**Apple's Tax Avoidance:**
* Timothy Cook raised question of responsibility at a congressional hearing
* Government's role to close loopholes vs companies' responsibility
* Impact on public perception and trust in Apple

**The Largest Ships: A Historical Perspective:**
* Predominantly ferries before 20th century
* Regulations based on old breed of vessels
* Outdated regulations led to insufficient lifeboats on larger ships

**Titanic Tragedy:**
* Carried fewer lifeboats than required by law due to size
* Owner adhered to outdated regulation
* Insufficient lifeboats resulted in over 1,500 deaths out of 2,224 passengers and crew.

#### Abstraction's Impact on Moral Decision Making in Business Leadership

**The Titanic and Apple: A Correlation of Outdated Regulations and Moral Decision Making**

**Background:**
- Shipping industry's reluctance to update regulations regarding lifeboats
- Cost and stability concerns led to insufficient lifeboats on the Titanic
- Parallels with Apple's tax evasion arguments

**Historical Context:**
1. **Lobbying against change**: Shipping industry argued against adding lifeboats due to perceived negative impact on business.
2. **Fear of appearing unsafe**: Car manufacturers faced similar concerns regarding seat belts.
3. **Tax evasion**: Apple and others contend that paying taxes hurts their ability to compete, just like the shipping companies in early 20th century.

**Impact on Trust:**
- Lack of transparency and moral principles can damage public trust.
- Being a company or person of high moral character is essential for building trust.

**Leadership and Moral Authority:**
1. **Higher authority**: A sense of purpose, vision, or noble cause helps make the right decisions.
2. **Responsibility**: Embracing responsibility to care for people instead of numbers builds trust and effective leadership.
3. **Abstraction's impact**: Making decisions without considering human lives can be damaging; staying connected with those affected is crucial.

**Moral Decision Making:**
1. **Milgram’s experiment**: The need for a higher authority or sense of purpose in decision making.
2. **Importance of visual contact**: Seeing those we are protecting helps us make the right moral decisions and take responsibility when needed.
3. **Managing abstraction**: Finding ways to keep our "Circles strong" is essential to reduce the damaging effects on moral decision making.

### 15. Managing the Abstraction

**Story 1: The Syrian Civil War**
- **Background:**
    - Syria experiencing civil war inspired by Arab Spring
    - Bashar al-Assad's regime met rebellion with intense brutality
    - World opinion failed to stop violence
- **Impact:**
    - Over 100,000 Syrians killed, including nearly 1,500 in chemical attack

- **Background:**
    - Eighteen-year-old girl hit by car
    - Critical condition, later died at hospital
- **Impact:**
    - Personal tragedy: one life lost
- **Implications:**
    - Comparison of personal vs. large-scale tragedies
    - Emotional response to each story.

#### The Limitations of Abstract Numbers in Empathy and Leadership

**Impact of Numbers vs Personal Connection**

**Numbers as Abstract Concepts:**
- Large numbers representing people lose emotional impact
- Difficult to empathize with abstract statistics or polls
- Lack of tangibility hinders problem solving and innovation

**Personal Connections:**
- Importance of knowing constituents personally
- Understanding the name, details of their lives
- Making abstract concepts real and understanding human consequences

**Virtual World vs Reality:**
- Internet enables operating at scale and connecting easily
- Expedites transactions and communication
- However, online relationships lack deep trusting connections

**Impact of Numbers on Empathy:**
- Stalin's example: large numbers lead to empathy failure
- Personal loss has significant emotional burden compared to abstract statistics
- Decisions made using spreadsheets lose tangibility and become abstractions.

#### The Limits and Limitations of Virtual Relationships

**The Role of Social Media in Building Relationships**

**Impact of Virtual Likes and Followers:**
- Serotonin burst from virtual admiration (pictures, pages, posts)
- No sacrifice required, different than real relationships
- Virtual relationships not as strong as face-to-face connections

**Online Communication and Cyberbullying:**
- One quarter of U.S. teens experience cyberbullying
- Abstraction can lead to abhorrent behavior
- Distance allows for anonymity and potential misconduct

**Virtual Relationships vs. Real Friendships:**
- Online relationships lack trust, love, and long-lasting feelings
- Face-to-face meetings are essential for social animals
- Virtual communication can't replace human connection

**Benefits of Live Events:**
- Sharing ideas in person
- Meeting people with similar interests or careers
- Building strong bonds of trust through face-to-face interactions.

**Virtual Trust vs. Real Life:**
- No such thing as virtual trust
- Trust forms across a table, not through a screen
- Handshake is essential for binding humans.

#### Bill Gore's Magic Number: Maintaining Company Culture at Scale

**Importance of Human Interaction**
- Real, live human interaction is crucial for feeling part of something, developing trust, and having empathy for others
- Telecommuters often feel disconnected from their teams due to lack of social time and nuance

**Impact of Virtual Communication**
- Video conferencing and webinars are cheaper alternatives to real conferences and business trips in the short term
- Long-term effects of dehumanizing communication methods are yet to be fully realized

**Gore's Company Growth and Downsizing**
- Bill Gore founded W.L. Gore & Associates in his basement with his wife, Vieve
- Discovery of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or GORE-TEX led to rapid growth and expansion
- As the company grew, Gore realized that having too many employees could negatively impact camaraderie and teamwork
- Capped factories at 150 people to maintain strong relationships among employees

**Success of Gore's Model**
- Business continued to boom under this model
- Employees stayed engaged and cooperative, contributing to the company's success
- Today, Gore has sales of $3.2 billion per year and employs over 10,000 people worldwide
- Attempts to organize plants and offices into working groups of about 150 people.

#### The Anthropological Basis for Optimal Group Size: Dunbar's Number

**Bill Gore's Observation and Dunbar's Number**

**Background:**
- Bill Gore trusted his gut based on personal observations
- Robin Dunbar, British anthropologist, discovered the same conclusion: people can maintain around 150 close relationships

**Dunbar's Findings:**
- Earliest groups of Homo sapiens lived in hunter/gather tribes of 100-150 people
- Amish and Hutterite communities, Bushmen of South Africa, Native Americans, Marines: all function best at around 150 members
- Reasons for optimal group size: time and brain capacity

**Time:**
- Twenty-four hours in a day; forming deep bonds takes time
- Humans can't maintain many relationships if only given two minutes per person

**Brain Capacity:**
- Human brain has a limit to the number of relationships it can manage effectively
- Dunbar’s Number is around 150 for most people, some can remember more or fewer

**Impact on Organizations:**
- Larger groups require rigid social systems and effective hierarchy for trust and cooperation
- Strong human relationships are essential to managing organizations at scale

**Internet and Social Media:**
- The Internet doesn't negate Dunbar's Number
- People maintain fewer genuine connections online compared to offline
- Dunbar’s findings remain relevant in the digital age.

#### The Impact of Personal Connection in Leadership and Organization Growth

**Impact of Personal Connections in Organizations:**
* In small organizations, personal relationships lead to better care and protection (:)
* Known individuals receive priority over abstract ones for leadership attention (:)
* Ownership and accountability foster strong circles of safety (:)
* Breakdown of personal connections leads to hierarchies in larger organizations (:)
* CEOs can't provide real care until abstraction is mitigated (:)
* Managers must become leaders at every level (:)
* Larger groups result in fewer trusting relationships among employees (:)
* Open-plan offices don't necessarily improve communication or cooperation as organizations grow (:).

#### "The Power of Personal Connection in Fundraising"

**Ruling 3: Meet the People**

**Grant's Study on Fundraising Effectiveness**:
- Grant, a management professor at Wharton School, studied university fund-raisers to understand effective techniques
- Fund-raisers called alumni to persuade them to donate for scholarships
- Pitch was inspiring but had moderate success due to high turnover and repetitive tasks
- Grant proposed bringing scholarship recipients to the office for a brief interaction with fund-raisers

**Impact of Face-to-Face Interaction**:
- Students shared how scholarships changed their lives, expressing gratitude to fund-raisers
- Fund-raisers experienced 400% increase in weekly revenue and significant improvements in call duration and donations
- Control group without student visits showed no improvement
- Listening to a manager's description of students' impact also had no effect

**Importance of Seeing Impact**:
- As social animals, we are motivated by the tangible impact of our work
- This positive feedback reinforces our efforts and inspires us to do better

#### The Power of Seeing the Impact of Our Work on Others

**The Power of Seeing Results in Our Work**

**Impact of Seeing Results**:
- Bosses telling us our work is important is less powerful than seeing it ourselves
- The loan department at Wells Fargo had dramatic results when a customer came in to describe how a loan changed their life
- Seeing the impact of our work on someone's life can shift the perception and purpose of our jobs

**Radiologists' Accuracy**:
- Reading about a patient led to improved diagnostic accuracy for radiologists

**Lifeguards' Motivation**:
- Lifeguards who read about saving lives were more motivated and helped more swimmers

**Importance of Feeling Our Work Has Value**:
- Only 1% of executives believed managers should show employees that their work makes a difference
- Companies often focus on how the work will benefit us personally, rather than the benefits to others

**Cooperative Nature of Humans**:
- We are biologically more inspired and motivated when we know we are helping others

**The "Charity: Water" Approach**:
- Charity: Water sends photographs and GPS coordinates of the well that a donation paid for
- This allows donors to see the direct result of their donation, which can be powerful

#### Prioritizing Time and Effort Over Financial Contributions

**The Value of Time and Energy vs. Money**

**Impact of Actions on Brain**
- Line graph indicates success: pride and investment of time/energy follows
- Biological connection to humans: prioritize people over numbers

**Giving Help: Value Perception**
- Friendship and favors: focus on those who give time and effort
- Money as an abstraction: no real value to primitive brains
- Relative vs. absolute value
  - Money: variable, can be earned or saved back
  - Time/energy: finite, nonredeemable commodity

**Perception of Value in Relationships**
- Inherent premium on those who commit time and energy
- Absolute value: 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for everyone

**Wasting Time vs. Energy**
- Regret over lost time: irreplaceable
- Parental attention during children's activities: importance of giving energy as well

**Examples**
- Helping friends move: time and effort > money
- Sitting in a meeting or reading a book: time wasted, no energy given back.

#### The Power of Giving Time and Energy in Leadership

**The Importance of Listening and Giving Time and Energy**

**Listening**:
- Listening fully requires undivided attention
- Feeling that someone is listening builds trust and leadership
- A boss who sacrifices time to help is more valuable than one who only gives bonuses

**Loyalty and Leadership**:
- Loyalty comes from feeling leaders will sacrifice for their people
- Giving time and energy has a greater impact than just money
- CEOs with bad reputations can't redeem themselves through charity

**Giving Time and Energy**:
- Giving time and energy inspires others to do the same
- Leaders must offer time and energy to create a loyal workforce
- Managers will be more willing to give their time to subordinates
- Employees treating customers better follows from this

**Oxytocin and Serotonin**:
- These hormones make us feel good when time and energy are given
- Inspiring us to give more of ourselves to others
- Business is a human enterprise, built on relationships and connections

#### Building Trust Takes Time: The Role of Dopamine in Relationships

**Relationship Building:**
- Importance of taking time to build trust: not formed overnight or after one week
- Instinctive reaction to a great first date may be "that's crazy" but love can develop over time
- Strong positive feeling after a date is dopamine-fueled and not necessarily indicative of long-term trust
- Comparing short relationships to longer ones: if both parties feel they belong, it might be time to move on if trust isn't present
- Impatience in our world makes it difficult to form deep connections and build trust

**The Role of Dopamine:**
- Feeling good after a great first date or job interview doesn't equate to love or long-term trust
- Mislabeling feelings can lead us into relationships that may not last
- Strong positive feelings are predominantly dopamine-fueled and don't indicate stability

**Building Trust:**
- Takes time and patience, different for everyone
- Google, instant gratification, and instant information make it challenging to build deep connections
- Necessary to get to know someone well enough to rely on them in a relationship (personal or professional)

**Misconceptions about Trust:**
- Mislabeling feelings after short relationships can lead to false assumptions
- Lack of trust may indicate a need for change, not necessarily a problem with the other person.

### 16. Imbalance

**Impact of Surplus Economy:**
- Humans transitioned from subsistence to surplus economy around 10,000 years ago
- Populations grew beyond 150 people due to surplus production
- Societies could afford waste and luxuries not possible before
- Ruling classes emerged, leading to potential self-interest over societal good

**Effects of Unchecked Surplus:**
- Wealthy companies lobby for regulations that benefit themselves
- Organizations can become imbalanced when surplus is prioritized over selfless pursuits
- Destructive Abundance occurs when dopamine-driven behaviors overwhelm social protections
- Focusing solely on scores and forgetting original goals leads to this issue

**Causes of Destructive Abundance:**
- Mismanagement of resources and organizations
- Lack of leadership responsibility and ethics

### PART 6 DESTRUCTIVE ABUNDANCE. 17. Leadership Lesson 1 So Goes the Culture so Goes the Company

**Goldman Sachs Culture: Past and Present**

**Background:**
- Gustave "Gus" Levy's description of Goldman Sachs as a "long-term greedy" organization (1970)
- Reputation for loyalty to clients, high standards, and strong culture
- Difficult to get in; candidates had to fit the culture and put firm first

**Golden Years:**
- Culture built on trust, partnership, and long-term gains
- Academic qualifications not enough for entry
- Strong culture led Goldman through tough times

**Culture Shift:**
- 1990s: Beginning of decline in partnership culture
- Regulations loosened, leading to financial innovations and risks
- Embrace of more aggressive traders

**Impact:**
- Culture shift resulted in new opportunities for profits
- Goldman Sachs continued success but at the cost of strong values
- Partnership and loyalty no longer priority.

#### "The Impact of Corporate Culture on Reputation: Goldman Sachs as an Example"

**Goldman Sachs Cultural Shift**

**New Hiring Practices**:
- Academic pedigree and prior success given greater weight over cultural fit
- Arrival of new broker caused resentment among those who had built the company culture

**Two Distinct Cultures Emerge**:
- Old Goldman: Loyalty, long-term greed, balance of social chemicals
- New Goldman: Numbers, short-term targets, imbalanced dopamine levels
- Maximizing wealth and status at firm/client's expense led to damage to company culture and reputation

**Layoffs and Cultural Trauma**:
- Goldman Sachs first layoffs in the 1990s were highly traumatic
- Lack of prior emphasis on layoffs contributed to cultural shift

**Tarnished Reputation and Apology**:
- By 2010, Goldman Sachs' role in mortgage crisis and bailout bonuses led to negative reputation
- CEO Lloyd Blankfein issued halfhearted apology in November 2009

**Impact on Company Culture**:
- Cultural identity is important when away from the group or under threat
- Strong corporate cultures foster personal attachments among employees
- Employees identify with the company, forming a shared sense of belonging and values

#### Culture's Impact on Individual and Organizational Character

**The Importance of Company Culture and Character**

**Wearing Company "Schwag"**:
- When we have a sense of belonging, we wear company schwag in public with pride
- In a weak culture, we lose the sense of history, responsibility, and shared tradition

**Shifting Cultural Standards**:
- When cultural standards shift from character, values, or beliefs to performance, numbers, and impersonal measurements
- Behavior-driving chemicals fall out of balance, will to trust and cooperate dilutes
- The culture becomes "watered down" and loses its good and healthy qualities

**Company Character Defines Its Value**:
- A company's strong character promotes treating all people well, not just the ones who pay or earn money
- In a weak culture, people feel they need to manage politics, promote their own success, and watch their own backs
- The strength of a company's culture is the only thing we can truly rely on

**Words Reflecting Emotions**:
- Words like "love" and "pride" are feelings associated with oxytocin and serotonin
- Lack of these emotions, as in the case of Goldman Sachs, can indicate a weak culture and lack of belonging

**Leadership Responsibility:**
- Leaders decide what kind of environment to build
- Extending Circle of Safety to organization or focusing on inner circle?

**Goldman Sachs Employees:**
- Not inherently bad or evil
- Environment influences their behavior.

### 18. Leadership Lesson 2 So Goes the Leader so Goes the Culture

**Leadership Lesson 2: The Cult of Personality**

**The Rise of Saddam Hussein**:
- Saddam wanted to be the leader, no one would stand in his way
- Formed strategic alliances to bolster his position and ensure his rise
- Showered allies with wealth and power to keep them "loyal"
- Claimed to serve the people, but it was for himself, glory, fame, power, fortune

**Merrill Lynch's Corporate Culture Under O’Neal's Leadership:**
* Competitive atmosphere: focus on personal gain over collaboration (2001)
* Tone set by O’Neal: intense competition and individualism
* Effects of 9/11: layoffs, closed offices (2001-2002)
* Merrill board forced out Komansky, made O’Neal chairman and CEO (2002)

- Successfully isolated himself from employees and board
- Attempted merger with Wachovia without discussing it with directors
- Lost any potential support
- Left Merrill Lynch in disgrace, receiving a severance package worth over $160 million

**Irony of CEO Severance Packages**:
- Many CEOs advocate for "pay for performance" inside their companies
- Then expect large payouts when leaving the company in disgrace
- Shareholders and boards should prohibit such severance if the CEO leaves in shame

**O'Neal's Extreme Leadership Style**:
- Represented an extreme version of the thinking that had taken over Wall Street
- Isolated himself from those he led, fostering internal competition
- Stopped acting like a leader and became more like a tyrant, focused on wealth and power

**Tyrant Leader Behavior**:
- **Power gradually shuts the tyrant off from the world**
- Creates paranoia, seeing the world as against them
- Sets up rigid controls around their inner circle
- Organizational suffering ensues due to isolation and lack of cooperation

**Paranoid Leadership and Organization**:
- Individuals inside the organization are less likely to cooperate
- Competition becomes the best way to advance, leading to jealousy
- Possibility of entering the leader's inner circle creates paranoia and self-preservation focus

#### The Unanticipated Command: A Struggle for Change

**Captain Marquet's Career and Challenges:**
* Graduated from Naval Academy, top class (intelligent)
* Rise to command of USS Olympia, nuclear-powered submarine
* Spent a year studying Olympia's systems and crew
* Assigned to take command of USS Santa Fe instead of Olympia
* Santa Fe ranked last in readiness and retention measurements
* Saw the change as a challenge, believed he could turn it around.

**Background:**
* O'Neal changed company culture from certainty to uncertainty
* Lack of trust led to eventual collapse (similar to Iraq)

**Captain Marquet's Leadership Style:**
* Control focused at the top
* Believed he knew more than crew
* Worked hard to learn about systems and crew

**Sudden Change in Plans:**
* Assigned command of USS Santa Fe instead of Olympia
* Saw opportunity to turn around a struggling ship
* Believed giving good orders would lead to a good ship.

#### "Captain's Misunderstanding: A Two-Thirds Dilemma"

**Captain Marquet's New Command: Santa Fe**

**Background:**
- January 8, 1999: Captain Marquet steps onto USS Santa Fe
- $2 billion, longer than a football field vessel with advanced equipment
- Old habits and fear of losing respect led him to hide ignorance

**Initial Smooth Sailing:**
- Issued orders and crew followed
- Serotonin flowed, confidence increased

**Drill: Reactor Failure Simulation**
- Nuclear reactor manually shut down
- Crew performed checks and precautions
- Switched to electric motor (EPM)
- Captain pushed crew further with "Ahead two thirds" order

**Unexpected Challenge:**
- No two-thirds setting on battery-powered motor
- Helmsman squirmed in seat, unable to execute order
- Young sailor informed captain of issue

**Realization:**
- Navigator confirmed no two-thirds setting
- Captain's old habits led him to give orders without knowledge or understanding of new equipment.

#### Leadership Transformation in Nuclear Submarine Culture

**Captain Marquet's Leadership Lessons:**

**The Consequences of Top-Down Culture:**
- Blindly following orders can lead to disastrous consequences
- Captain Marquet realized he needed his crew's trust and collaboration instead of blind obedience
- In a top-down culture, leaders have all the authority but no information, while those at the bottom have all the information but no authority
- This prevents an organization from reaching its full potential

**The Problem with Control:**
- Captain Marquet was "addicted" to being in control
- His crew was trained for compliance instead of taking responsibility
- In organizations where few take responsibility, preventable failures can occur

**Leadership's True Role:**
- A leader's job is not to bark commands but to take responsibility for the success and wellbeing of each team member
- Leaders should ensure their crew is well-trained and confident in their duties
- Empowering the crew to make decisions will advance the mission

**Changing the Culture:**
- Captain Marquet shifted from a culture of permission to a culture of intent
- This enabled his crew to take calculated risks and make decisions, ultimately leading to better performance.

#### Empowering Leadership: Delegation and Shared Responsibility

**Captain Marquet's Leadership Style:**
- Replaced "permission to" with "I intend to" when delegating tasks
- Allowed subordinates to own their actions instead of carrying out assigned tasks
- Three responsibilities that cannot be delegated: legal responsibilities, relationships, and knowledge
  - These can be shared among team members
- Importance of sharing knowledge and resources within a Circle of Safety
  - Encourages trust and cooperation
  - Mistakes are viewed as opportunities for growth rather than something to be hidden
- Captain Marquet's focus on giving direction and intent, allowing others to figure out how to achieve it.

**Impact of Leadership Style:**
- Improved relationships and overall culture of trust aboard the Santa Fe
- Crew became the best-rated in Navy history
- Goal is for a leader to provide direction and allow team members to take responsibility for their actions.

**Challenges:**
- Organizations often train people to comply instead of encouraging them to think
- Lack of trust and transparency can lead to hiding mistakes or problems, which can escalate over time.

#### Empowering Crew: Balancing Organizational Chemicals for Success

**Captain Marquet's Leadership:**
* Created an environment that rewarded trust and cooperation beyond obedience and achievement
* Increased oxytocin and serotonin levels among crew, resulting in increased pride, concern for each other, and problem-solving abilities
* Crew went from waiting to be told what to do to sacrificing for the good of the whole
* Reenlistment rate improved significantly (from 3 to 30) and many officers were promoted to command their own ships
* Power definition: transfer of energy; Captain Marquet transferred more energy to those doing the job, making both organization and leaders more powerful.

### 19. Leadership Lesson 3 Integrity Matters

- Apologize for mistakes promptly and take responsibility.

#### Trust, Integrity and Leadership: The Life-or-Death Importance of Honesty in Politics

**Trust and Politicians:**
- **Reason for mistrust**: Politicians may not believe all they say due to perceived self-interest
- Alignment with our beliefs doesn't guarantee trust if we suspect dishonesty
- Trust builds through consistent, honest communication

**Ron Paul as an Exception:**

#### The Inequity of Executive Performance Bonuses in Corporate America

**Culture's Importance and Integrity vs. Growth**
- Culture sets organizations apart from competition (:)
- Strong culture: respects individuals, puts customers first, strives for excellence, trusted (:)
- Beliefs include people-first attitude and commitment to integrity (:)
- U.S. Marine Corps and Barry-Wehmiller as examples of strong cultures (:)

**Walmart's Priorities: Growth vs. Integrity?**
- Duke, Walmart CEO, prioritized growth over customers (:)
- Bonuses based on company performance rather than same-store sales (:)
- Easy goal to hit for overall revenues (:)
- Different priorities for executives vs. employees (:)
- Lack of understanding impact on others due to organizational scale (:)

**Impact of Abstraction on Leaders' Decision Making**
- Operating at large scale makes it challenging to extend the Circle of Safety beyond senior executives (:)
- Prioritizing own interests over others when leaders operate under conditions of abstraction (:)
- Inner circles take precedence over wider Circles of Safety.

#### The Price of Integrity: Ralph Lauren's Bribery Scandal

**Impact of Leadership on Company Culture**

**Leaders Set the Tone**:
- When leaders prioritize their own interests over others, they set a precedent for the entire company
- This creates a culture of hypocrisy, lies, and self-interest among employees

**Ralph Lauren Corporation's Actions**:
- In 2005-2009, employees in Argentinian subsidiary bribed government officials to fast-track shipments and skirt import regulations
- Upon learning about the crimes, Ralph Lauren executives **contacted U.S. authorities** and offered assistance in the investigation
- The company was later forced to pay penalties and fees, but this was worth it as they had demonstrated their integrity

**Importance of Truthfulness**:
- Building trust requires nothing more than telling the truth
- Failure to do so can lead to reputational damage that far outweighs any short-term financial gain

#### "Bank of America's Debit Card Fee Controversy"

**Trust and Corporate Lessons from Bank of America's Debit Card Fee Debacle**

**Lack of Trust towards Politicians and Corporations**:
- Our primitive brain evaluates everything in terms of survival
- This is why we don't trust politicians or big corporations
- Not due to politics or business, but their communication style

**Leadership and Trust**:
- Managers/leaders: Would you want to be in a foxhole with you?
- Companies: How strong are we if the answer is no?

**Bank of America Debit Card Fee Controversy**:
- Proposed $5 monthly debit card fee for non-affluent customers
- Outrage from customers, demonstrated opposition
- Company leaders refused to disclose impact on account closures

**Honesty and Trust**:
- Bank of America dropped the plan after public backlash
- Initially discussed fees within business circles, but not publicly
- Conveyed one message to financial community, another to public

#### The Hollow Promise of Corporate Sincerity

**Bank of America's Debit Fee Reversal**

**Background:**
- Bank of America initially announced plans to introduce a debit usage fee
- Customers expressed outrage through various channels
- The bank subsequently reversed their decision

**Initial Announcement**:
- Intended to "help customers take full advantage of all the additional features like fraud protection"
- Met with public backlash and criticism

**Revised Statement:**
- Bank of America will not implement debit usage fee
- Apologized for any inconvenience caused by previous announcement
- Admitted to underestimating customer reaction

**Impact on Trust:**

**Zen Buddhist Perspective:**
- How we do something is how we do everything (consistency in actions)

### 20. Leadership Lesson 4 Friends Matter

**The Dynamic Between Democrats and Republicans in Congress During the Early 1990s**

**Background:**
- Newt Gingrich, a Republican representative from Georgia's sixth congressional district, sought to give the Republicans control of Congress in the early 1990s.
- At that time, both parties worked well together and shared a common goal: getting things done for their constituents.
- Members of Congress lived in Washington D.C., attending the same churches, schools, and social events regardless of party affiliation.

**Collaborative Environment:**
- Democrats and Republicans argued and debated during the day but formed friendships at night.
- Relationships were based on trust and cooperation, allowing for effective collaboration in Congress.
- George McGovern (Democrat) and Bob Dole (Republican) were known to be close friends despite their political differences.
- Tip O'Neill (Democratic Speaker of the House) and Bob Michel (Republican leader) worked together, engaging in friendly interactions outside of work hours.

**Impact of Friendships:**
- Friendships between members of opposing parties provided perspective and a sense of common purpose.
- The ability to build trust and cooperate despite political differences contributed to the effectiveness of Congress at that time.

**Decline in Collaboration:**
- Over time, the focus on politics shifted, leaving little room for friendship and cooperation between parties.
- Friendships that once existed among members of opposing parties became fewer, making it difficult to bridge political divisions.

#### The Decline of Cooperation in Congress: New Fundraising Priorities

**Divisions in Congress: From Cooperation to Control**

**Background:**
- For most of the sixties, seventies, and eighties, Congress functioned despite existing divisions
- Democrats and Republicans cooperated, facilitated by physical proximity and interaction

**Gingrich's Impact:**
- Introduced a new goal: control instead of cooperation
- Disrupted the status quo to portray an corrupt system in need of overhaul
- Tactics included less time for members in Washington and increased fundraising

**Impact on Congress:**
- Members spent more time at home raising funds, reducing opportunities for interaction
- Trust diminished as a result of fewer face-to-face encounters between Democrats and Republicans
- Polarization grew due to various factors such as redistricting, media programming, and overreliance on the Internet
- Congress shifted from governing selflessly to governing for selfish gain.

**Modern Day:**
- Members claim they're spending more time in their districts to better serve constituents
- However, evidence suggests that most of this time is spent on fundraising efforts rather than understanding their needs or visiting factories.

#### The Fragmented State of US Politics and Public Trust

**Impact of Disconnection on Governing Body:**
* Focus shifts from needs of constituents to personal needs
* Pressure to make numbers, win elections and stay in power
* Lack of relationship building and common ground

**Model Schedule for Congress Members:**
* 4 hours for fundraising calls
* 1-2 hours for constituent visits
* 2 hours for work on the floor or in committee
* 1 hour for strategic outreach (breakfasts, meet and greets, press)
* 1 hour of recharge time
* Possible underestimation of fundraising hours by DCCC

**Effects of Partisanship:**
* Hostilities between parties at an all-time high
* Debates taken to the floor instead of seeking consensus in committee first
* Olympia Snowe, a longtime senator, decided not to stand for reelection due to frustration with the current environment and lack of productivity.

**Consequences:**
* Growing number of people leaving public service because of caustic environment
* Lack of trust and progress in government
* Approval rating of US Congress among Americans at a low 14% (Gallup poll, January 2013).

#### Congressional Trust and Cooperation: The Biological Basis

**Lack of Trust and Cooperation in Congress**

**Low Approval Rating**:
- Congress' approval rating is lower than used car salesmen and Genghis Khan
- Majority of Americans believe the way politics work in Washington is harmful to the country

**Polarized Congress**:
- The 112th Congress was the most polarized in history, passing fewer laws than any time since the 1940s
- Previous Congresses were more cooperative, with over 100 more bills passed into law
- Lack of cooperation leads to less progress on issues like deficit reduction, Social Security reform, and climate change

**Factors Blamed**:
- Public blames the inability of members of Congress to work together for the economic crisis of 2008
- Polarized Congress cited for lack of progress on various issues
- Members blame "the system" or the media, but ignore their own role in the problem

**Biological Causes**:
- Lack of time spent together and getting to know each other limits the flow of social chemicals
- Raising money and winning elections become the primary incentive, leading to distrust and lack of cooperation

**Case Study: Agriculture Committee Delegation in Romania**:
- Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Stephanie Herseth Sandlin (D-SD) were the only two delegates with nothing to do after a day of meetings

#### "Bipartisan Friendship Blooms on a Romanian Trip"

**Souvenir Shopping Trip Leads to Unexpected Friendship**

**Background:**
- Representatives Herseth Sandlin (Democrat) and Goodlatte (Republican) served on the same committee but were adversaries due to unwritten Congress rules.
- Their relationship was previously cordial at best until a shopping trip in Romania changed everything.

**The Shopping Trip:**
- Without work responsibilities, they got to know each other better and discovered commonalities.
- The serene environment allowed them to see past their political differences.

**Foundation of Friendship:**
- They started having meals together in Washington for no reason other than enjoying each other's company.
- They began treating each other as human beings instead of adversaries.

**Impact on Their Relationship:**
- They learned to trust one another and work towards compromises, even if it meant going against party lines.
- They continued having a mutual respect and friendship despite their political differences.

**Outcome:**
- Representatives Herseth Sandlin and Goodlatte voted in opposition to each other most of the time but still managed to agree on certain things for the greater good.

#### Building Friendships Across Party Lines for Collaborative Governance

**Relationship Building in Congress:**
* Representative Goodlatte and Herseth Sandlin's friendship an exception
* Cooperation not agreement, based on respect and service (2006)
* Disappointment of GOP leadership due to their working relationship
* Comparison with Olympia Snowe's health care reform vote and party backlash

**Background:**
* Lack of relationships in Congress recognized as problematic
* Feward-thinking members held retreats for civility (Hershey, PA)
* Dr. William Ury: peace negotiator, coauthor of Getting to Yes
* Representatives spent more time with other party during retreats than entire careers

**Importance of Relationships:**
* Encourages civility and understanding
* Humanizes each other
* Essential for making peace and resolving conflicts

**Current System:**
* Lack of investment in relationships hinders cooperation
* Driven by desire to win elections and maintain power

**Individual Members' Role:**
* Hope lies with progress-minded individuals
* Reach out for drinks or meals with no agenda
* Cooperation will happen over time.

**Introduction to Shareholder Value:**
- First proposed by Milton Friedman
- Developed by William Meckling and Michael Jensen in 1976
- Appealing to activist corporate raiders and CEOs

**Impact on Corporations:**
- Focus on increasing shareholder value instead of overall performance
- Potential consequences: short-term gains, long-term damage
- Shareholder value myth critique by Lynn Stout in 2012 (The Shareholder Value Myth)

#### The Rise of Shareholder Value and "Neutron Jack"

**Impact of Corporate Raiding on Companies during the 1980s and 1990s:**
- **Carl Icahn and other corporate raiders sought undervalued companies for takeover**
- **Forced boards to cut expenses through layoffs or selling assets**
- **Executive pay linked directly to stock performance (options, bonuses)**
- **Maximizing shareholder value became primary focus**

**Impact on Executives:**
- **CEOs paid according to stock price instead of salaries and bonuses**
- **First generation of billionaire CEOs without founding or taking companies public**
- **Jack Welch and Roberto Goizueta pioneered shareholder value principle**

**Impact on General Electric (GE):**
- **Sales increased from $26.8 billion to $130 billion under Welch's tenure**
- **Market cap rose thirty times, making it the most valuable company in the world**
- **Welch fired bottom 10% and rewarded top 20% based on division contribution to share price**
- **Nicknamed "Neutron Jack" for focusing solely on shareholder value**

**Criticism of Welch's Approach:**
- **GE's performance matched market trajectory during Welch's tenure**
- **Anyone could have achieved similar results with the rising tide (oil company example)**

#### The Dilemma of Leadership Succession: Empowerment vs. Control

**Jack Welch's Leadership Style at GE:**
* Profitable during his tenure: half of profits from core business, half from financial arm (GE Capital)
* Focused on short-term value maximization
* Build to Last study by Collins and Porras criticizes leadership that relies on a single genius at the top
* Lack of focus on developing people and distributing power weakens company's long-term success

**Impact of Directive vs. Empowering Leaders:**
* Initial higher performance for directive leaders, but lower improvement over time
* Empowering leaders foster team learning, coordination, empowerment, and mental model development
* Importance of succession planning and creating a strong foundation for future growth

**The Circle of Safety:**
* Leaders should focus on training, building, and protecting their people instead of commanding and controlling
* Strong company success depends less on one person and more on the organization's capabilities
* Empowerment leads to higher performance improvement over time.

#### The Dark Side of Corporate America: Layoffs and Shareholder Primacy

**Impact of Layoffs on Employee Morale**
- At some companies, layoffs are a normal occurrence during specific quarters to meet financial projections
- Employees take extreme measures to protect themselves before announcements, such as filing complaints for harassment, discrimination, and whistleblowing protection
- This increase in complaints is not evenly distributed throughout the year but occurs during the period when companies prepare layoffs
- Employees may file complaints to protect their bonuses and jobs

**Impact of Layoffs on Corporate Culture**
- Welch and others pioneered using people as an expendable resource in the 1980s for the benefit of investors
- Companies now commonly use layoffs to boost their bottom line, often ending careers, without considering employee contributions or performance
- This creates a culture where hard work doesn't necessarily guarantee job security or success

**Shareholder Primacy and Its Effects on Corporations**
- By the mid-1990s, shareholder primacy became the mantra of corporate America
- Unbalanced dopamine levels and excessive cortisol flow led to limited empathy and self-interest dominance
- This resulted in issues such as stock manipulation, massive pay inequality, and accounting fraud that continue today

**Leadership's Role in Protecting Company Interests**
- It is reasonable for company leaders to protect the interests of their owners
- However, shareholders may not truly own the companies they manage
- Professor Stout argues that Friedman's perspective on capitalism was misguided.

#### The Myth of Shareholder Value Maximization: A Case Study of BP's Deepwater Horizon Disaster

**Corporate Ownership and Shareholder Value Maximization**

**Corporate Ownership**:
- Corporations own themselves, not shareholders
- No legal requirement to maximize share price

**Criticisms of Shareholder Value Maximization**:
- Professor Stout argues it has failed
- Negatively impacted employees and companies
- Shareholders have seen lower returns over time

**Example: BP Disaster**
- Catastrophic explosion aboard Deepwater Horizon rig in 2010
- Killed 11 workers, caused environmental disaster
- Resulted from BP's practice of cutting safety corners to save costs
- Previous safety violations indicated neglectful attitude towards safety procedures

#### Short-Term Decisions, Long-Term Consequences: The BP Deepwater Horizon Disaster

**Deepwater Horizon Disaster:**
- **BP and Transocean Workers' Safety Concerns**: A survey revealed workers felt the Deepwater rig was unsafe just weeks before the blast. Despite this, owners ignored warnings due to dopamine-driven focus and shortsightedness.
- **Delays and Cost Overruns**: The project was already six weeks behind schedule and $58 million over budget by spring 2005. Each additional day's delay cost an extra $1 million for BP.
- **Legal Consequences**: BP pleaded guilty to eleven felony counts, faced millions of claims, paid $713 million in tax revenues, and was fined $17.6 billion for environmental violations. The overall settlement cost exceeded $7.8 billion.
- **Impact on Shareholders**: If BP had delayed well development to follow proper safety measures, it could have saved money instead of losing it due to the oil spill. Shares dropped significantly post-spill and remained below pre-spill levels nearly three years later.
- **Industry Wide Impact**: The ban on drilling in the Gulf and longer permit process for offshore oil/gas cost the United States over $24 billion in lost investments and 162,000 jobs between 2010 and 2013. Shareholders of companies affected by tourism also suffered financial harm.
- **Executive Shortsightedness**: The rise of shareholder primacy and external incentives has led executives to focus on short-term gains over long-term value creation, with an average CEO tenure of only five years. Companies like BP and Enron were not built for hard times.

#### The Dangers of Shareholder-First Mentality in Leadership

**CEOs and Shareholder Value**
- Companies like Worldcom, Tyco had hero CEOs who maximized short-term shareholder value at the expense of employees
- Welch himself later called focus on shareholder value "the dumbest idea in the world"
- Emphasis on shareholder value creates cultures where employees feel uncertain and insecure

**Impact on Employees and Culture**
- Executives neglect leading employees due to short-term results pressure
- Fear of job loss leads to fight or flight response, making relationship building difficult
- Whole organization suffers as a result

**Role of Shareholders**
- During dot-com bubble, shareholders invested based on tips and ignored research
- Sought instant wealth without thoroughly checking facts
- Blindly trusted information regardless of source

**Leadership by the People**
- Company performance closely tied to CEO's personality and values
- Welch's celebrity culture at GE pitted employees against each other, driving them to make themselves look good.

### PART 7 A SOCIETY OF ADDICTS. 22. At the Center of All Our Problems Is Us

**Puerperal Fever Epidemic**

**Background:**
- Confined Mrs. _____ on May 7, 1800s for childbirth
- Died on May 10 due to severe chill and fever (puerperal fever)
- High mortality rate: 70% - 80% in hospitals during epidemic
- Symptoms: fever, abdominal pain, death shortly after childbirth

**Effects on Medical Community:**
- Intellectual class determined to reform society with science
- Enlightenment Age: empirical data and expertise valued
- Doctors attempted to explain puerperal fever cause and prevention

**Doctor's Role in Spread:**
- Surgeons performed autopsies, failed to wash hands or sterilize instruments
- Limited understanding of germs (1843: Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes proposed solution)

**Impact on Doctors:**
- Moral obligation to purify instruments and burn clothing for infected women
- Failure to consider the significance of their own role in spreading puerperal fever.

#### The Hazards of Business Metrics and the Magic of Substance Abuse

**The Controversy Surrounding Puerperal Fever**
- **Dr. Holmes' essay on puerperal fever**: Stirred controversy among some of his peers
- He was criticized by those he accused of causing the disease through autopsies
  - "Doctors are not the cause, they are gentlemen"
- However, the evidence Dr. Holmes presented was hard to dispute
  - More women contracted the disease after autopsies were performed on them
  - Some doctors who performed autopsies also contracted the disease
- It took 12 years for the medical community to accept responsibility and implement adequate sterilization practices

**The Parallels with Modern Business Practices**
- We live in a new "Age of Enlightenment"
- Our "men of science" are now "men of business and economics"
- They rely on metrics, efficiency, Lean, Six Sigma, ROI, and empirical data to guide decisions
- Managers rely on managers to manage these systems and numbers
- Leaders are needed to look after the people, not just the results
- Managers of metrics have an opportunity to become leaders of people

**Modern-Day Addiction and Recovery**
- "A Very Modern Addiction" refers to a person's experience with addiction
- The author compares this to the feeling of "Dutch courage" or confidence boost from alcohol

#### "Adolescence and Alcoholism: The Role of Social Anxiety"

- Instant gratification: alcohol's effectiveness in dealing with anxieties.

#### The Dopamine Trap of Modern Incentives

**Dopamine Addictions and Corporate Incentives**

**Dopamine and Rewards**:
- Dopamine is the chemical released when we accomplish something or find what we're looking for
- It is an internal incentive designed to encourage us to engage in behaviors for survival and prosperity
- Dopamine was built for a time when food was not readily available

**Dopamine-driven Addictions**:
- Bingeing, gambling, drinking, and smoking are dopamine addictions
- They provide a short-circuit to the reward system
- When unable to control dopamine urges, they become addictions

**Corporate Incentives and Dopamine Addiction**:
- Corporate cultures create environments for dopamine-driven addiction
- Incentive programs focus on performance and financial rewards
- These are usually based on short-term individual goal achievement

**Impact of Imbalanced Reward Systems**:
- Unlike prehistoric ancestors, modern work environments have unbalanced reward systems
- Dopamine-releasing incentives predominantly exist
- This can lead to an addiction to performance and a disregard for long-term or team goals

#### The Danger of Internal Competition within Organizations

**Effects of Competitive Incentives in Companies:**

### 23. At Any Expense

**Regulations to Balance Benefits and Costs:**
* Oil drilling: regulations ensure resource extraction benefits are balanced with land preservation
* Broadcast industry in early 20th century: Radio Act of 1927 organized the system, later replaced by Communications Act of 1934 and establishment of FCC
* Public service programming requirement for broadcasters to maintain licenses
	+ Networks provided news as a way to build integrity and avoid losing licenses
	+ Walter Cronkite, Ted Koppel: considered mission-driven journalists in the 1960s
	+ News served as "loss leader" allowing networks to profit from entertainment divisions.

**The Iran Hostage Crisis (November 4, 1979):**
* Islamist students and militants stormed American embassy in Tehran, took captive fifty-two Americans.

* Symptoms: underreporting important stories, overindulgence in entertaining ones
* Conflict of interest for media outlets that prioritize ratings and advertising revenues
* Lamentation of noble pursuit replaced by commercial one (Koppel)
* Comparison with doctors prescribing desired drugs instead of necessary ones.

- Destructive consequences under Boomer watch

**Impact on Reality Perception**
- Addiction causes loss of reality and regret among some Boomers
- David Komansky (former Merrill Lynch CEO): regrets leading Glass-Steagall repeal
- John Reed (former Citigroup co-CEO): also believes it was a bad idea

**Dismantling of Protective Controls**
- Beginning in 1980s and 1990s, some Boomers dismantled protective controls
- Leaders in companies and government created a strong inner circle with disregard for others

**Impact on Society**
- Weakening of country: focusing on protecting themselves instead of advancing society as a whole
- Next generation dealing with own addictions, ill-equipped to fix problems of previous generation.

**Misplaced Leadership Priorities**
- Leaders supposed to look after those in their care and consider environmental protection
- Weak leadership can lead to dismantling protective measures for individuals and society.

### 24. The Abstract Generation

#### The Distracted Generation: Technology's Impact on Focus and Attention

**Gen X vs Gen Y:**
* Gen Xers didn't practice nuclear attack drills in school during the 1980s and 1990s
* Good life for Gen X with boom years, technology advancements like e-commerce, e-mail, free shipping
* Generation Y has a reputation for entitlement but perceived as impatience instead
* Instant gratification misconception of success, money, happiness
* Economic systems prioritize numbers over people
* Short circuit to internal reward systems in Gen Yers and all generations
* Impact of technology on relationships and communication

**Imagined Scenario:**
* Flying at 35,000 feet on a calm flight from New York to Seattle with seasoned pilots and modern avionics
* Air traffic controller in charge of monitoring air traffic in his sector
* Controller is allowed to text or check email during duty hours
* Most would not feel comfortable with controller using phone while on duty
* Preference for complete forbidden access to Internet and personal cell phones.

#### The Impact of Digital Distraction on ADHD in Generation Y

**Impact of Technologies on Concentration**
* Lives are at stake due to inability to concentrate
* Multitasking myth debunked: Generation Y is better at being distracted (Northwestern University study)
* Increase in ADHD diagnoses (66% between 2000 and 2010)
	+ Misdiagnosis or genuine cases?

* Young people developing an addiction to distraction (conditioned behavior)
* Insatiable craving for immediate responses
* Social media replacing cigarettes as the new twenty-first century "drug"
* Impatience and isolation among younger generation.

#### The Paradox of Modern Activism: Brief Efforts for Lasting Change

**Impact of Social Media on Coping Mechanisms for Gen Y**

**Positive Affirmations and Virtual Relationships**:
- Replacing real trusting relationships as coping mechanisms
- Potential for a generation that struggles to find happiness and fulfillment more than preceding generations

**Desire to Make an Impact**:
- Gen Yers disillusioned with entry-level jobs or quitting to find one that "allows them to make an impact in the world"
- Failure to commit time and effort to one thing long enough to see the effect of service

**Awareness vs. Commitment**:

- Lack of commitment and grit, replaced by giving short bursts of energy and effort to many things

**Symbolic Gestures vs. Real Action**:
- Gen Yers respond to social causes with symbolic gestures like sharing videos or texting donations
- Failure to understand that real commitment requires significant time and energy investment

**1:Face Watch**:
- Offers young, fashionable do-gooders the opportunity to "do good without actually doing anything"
- Unspecified portion of profits go to related charities, but wearers believe they are "helping to raise awareness"

#### The Escalating Epidemic of Isolation and Loneliness in Modern Society

**The Rise of Virtual Activism and Its Limitation**

- Plight of others is a human problem, not technology issue

**Impact of Social Isolation**
- Feeling of loneliness and isolation can lead to dangerous antisocial behavior
- **Baby Boomer suicide rates** have increased significantly:
  - Suicide became one of leading causes of death in this age group
  - Biggest increase seen among men in their fifties (50% rise)
  - More people now die from suicide than car accidents

**Concerns for Future Generations**
- Younger generations may rely on Facebook, prescription drugs or online support groups as primary coping mechanisms instead of real relationships
- Predicted rise in depression, prescription drug abuse, suicide and other anti-social behaviors
- Increase in school shootings:
  - More than 10,000% increase since 1960
  - Most shooters were born after 1980 and around age of fourteen or fifteen
  - Felt lonely, outcast, and disassociated from schools, communities, or families.

#### The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health and Well-being

**Impact of Social Exclusion**
- **Sick gazelles**: pushed to edge of herd, at risk of being preyed upon
- **Primitive mammal brain**: leads us to similar conclusions when feeling outside Circle of Safety
- Feeling isolated and abandoned: can make us feel out of control, desperate
- **Virtual relationships**: may not solve real-life problems, could worsen situation
  - Comparison with others on social media can lead to depression
  - Study found more Facebook use correlates with lower life satisfaction

**Current State of Affairs**
- **Me Generation**: addicted to performance, dismantled protective controls
- **Distracted Generation**: living in a world of abstraction, dopamine-fueled addiction to social media and cell phones
- Seemingly at the "abyss"

**Conclusion**
- We are our own best hope for solutions.

### PART 8 BECOMING A LEADER. 25. Step 12

**The Dangers Within: Organizational Addictions and Suicide of Civilizations**
* We are facing a crisis in organizational cultures that bring out the worst in us
* Cynical, paranoid, selfish behavior leading to addiction and health risks

**Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Recovery from Addiction**
* AA's twelve-step program for beating alcoholism
* Admitting addiction is only step one, hard work of recovery follows
* Commitment to help another alcoholic crucial for overcoming addiction (Step Twelve)
* Real connections are essential in the fight against addiction

**The Role of Oxytocin and Serotonin in Addiction Recovery**
* Oxytocin fights withdrawal symptoms in addicts and prevents physical dependence
* Increased levels of oxytocin strengthen bonds of trust and love, helping beat addiction

**The Importance of Human Connections in Overcoming Challenges**
* Support from others is crucial for enduring hardships
* Real human bonds provide strength to manage stress and anxiety
* Group support helps individuals cope with depression, loneliness, failure, and more.

### 26. Shared Struggle

**The Waste of Food and Resources in Developed and Developing Worlds**

**Food Waste in Developed World:**
- **50% of ready-to-harvest food** goes uneaten (Jones, 2004)
- **14% of household food purchases** are wasted
- Average American family throws out nearly $600 per year
- Simple preservation techniques could save families $43 billion annually

**Food Spoilage in Developing World:**
- **50% of postharvest food grains** will not be eaten due to spoilage and improper storage (Stockholm International Water Institute)
- Developing world loses same amount as the United States through spoilage

**Commonalities:**
- Prodigal ways are not a new phenomenon
- Society's lack of perceived burden on resources
- Commoditization leads to diminished appreciation for remarkable value

**Impact of Waste:**
- Less hardship means less cooperation and oxytocin release
- Fewer volunteers before natural disasters
- Abundance of food, resources, and choices taken for granted.

**Organizational Leadership:**
- Leaders waste goodwill of people (implied)
- Unsustainable practices may not last long term.

#### The Power of Shared Struggle and Oxytocin in Teams

**Abundance Destroys Value**
- **Struggle**: Appreciation for things we work hard to obtain or have difficulty getting
  - Diamond: deep in the ground
  - Career success
  - Relationships
- Struggle gives value to things

**Best Days at Work**
- Not when everything goes smoothly and easily
  - Lack of fondness for "good days"
- Remembered fondly: projects with hardship shared among the team
  - Staying late, eating cold pizza, making deadline
- Fond memories due to camaraderie, group coming together

**Biological Connection**
- Bodies release oxytocin during struggle, bringing people closer together
- Incentivizes helping behavior for survival of tribe/organization

**Military Experiences**
- Highly recalled fondly: time deployed with the military
  - Austere conditions, real threats
- Gratitude for help and support from others
- Contrary to popular belief, lower suicide rates among those who deploy
  - Theory: less isolation, fewer emotional struggles when team is together.

#### The Paradox of Abundance and Innovation

**Understanding Human Behavior in Times of Scarcity and Abundance**

**The Benefits of Unity During Hardship**:
- When resources are scarce and danger is present, people naturally come together
- This unity is evident in the cooperation of uniformed services during combat
- However, this camaraderie often disappears when resources are abundant and threats are abstract

**Redefining Hardship in the Modern Age**:
- We need to learn how to operate as a species that thrives on working together to manage hardships
- This does not require giving up abundance, but rather reframing our visions to match our available resources

**Innovation and Small Businesses**:
- Smaller, less resourced companies often outcompete large corporations in innovation
- Size and resources are not the advantage - shared struggle and a common goal are more important
- Companies like Apple have been successful in creating new products and competing in new industries

**The Dangers of Abundance**:
- Our internal systems can become disrupted when exposed to environments of abundance
- We are at greater risk of succumbing to addictive behaviors driven by short-term incentives

#### Inspiring Organizational Growth Through Visionary Leadership

**The Importance of Leadership and Challenge in Organizations**

**Oxytocin and Serotonin**:
- Necessary for people to pull together effectively
- Flow more easily when dangers and opportunities are exaggerated relative to the organization's size

**Small Companies**:
- Struggle due to survival fears
- Growth is an abstract concept, not a compelling motivator
- Need a reason to grow and tackle challenges

**Large, Successful Companies**:
- Don't fear for their existence
- Growth as a motivation is less effective
- Need a challenge that outsizes resources but not intellect

**Leadership and Vision**:
- Leaders of great organizations frame daunting challenges
- Aim to "put a dent in the universe" or achieve something beyond current capabilities
- Innovation comes from framing challenges relative to existing capacity

**Examples of Inspiring Leadership**:
- Bill Gates: Put a PC on every desk
- Steve Jobs: Adapt technology to fit our lives, not vice versa

#### The Power of Purpose in Leadership and Business Success

**The Value of Purpose**

**Impact of Having a Strong Sense of Purpose:**
- Inspires individuals to invent, advance companies, and potentially change industries or the world
- Provides strength not to follow orders blindly

**Milgram's Obedience Experiment:**
- Belief in higher authority reduces likelihood of following harmful orders
- Leaders and companies with strong purpose do better in the long term

**Importance of Higher Authority:**
- Neither bosses nor clients are ultimate authorities
- Profit is a means, not a destination

**Leadership Examples:**
1. **Bob Chapman (Barry-Wehmiller):**
   - Profit as fuel, not destination
   - Answers to higher authority
   - Responsibility to employees
2. **James Sinegal (Costco):**
   - Prioritized responsibility to employees over shareholders
3. **Marines:**
   - Put Marines before themselves
4. **Southwest Airlines CEOs:**
   - Focused on serving employees, which in turn benefits customers and stakeholders

**The Cause of Human Inspiration:**
- Serving others, not self-interest
- Fifty thousand years of human history driven by service to others

**Selfish Desires vs. Causes:**
- Companies declaring global leadership or household name aspirations are selfish desires with no intended value beyond the company
- A cause bigger than the company inspires humans.

### 27. We Need More Leaders

**Empathy and Leadership:**
- **Johnny Bravo's realization**: Empathy is not just for employees or customers, but a continuous commitment to everyone. (1-2)
- Empathy vs. leadership: Theories like Milton Friedman's vs. Jim Sinegal's (3)
  * Thrilling vs. stable and sustainable
  * Gambling approach vs. long-term commitment
* Leadership as responsibility, not license (4-5)
- The impact of effective leadership on organizations: Tangible benefits (6)
- Misconceptions about leadership styles: Preference for thrill over hard work (7)
- Balance in economy: Importance of various leadership approaches (8)
- Leadership as parenting: Committing to well-being and making sacrifices (9)
- Force equals mass times acceleration (10)
  * Applying large force with caution (10-11)
- Leadership at all levels: Everyone's responsibility (12)
- Inspiring others through action, one day at a time (13).
