#### Roman Imperial Administration and Religion: Comparing Diocletian, Trajan, and Stoicism

**Marcus Aurelius and Diocletian's Reigns:**
* Marcus Aurelius: created dangerous innovation by elevating Verus as a companion in empire, leading to Roman Empire's split into halves
* Centralization in civil administration was too strict under Diocletian
* Strong point: effective administration of justice
* Protected weak, made life easier for slaves, endowed charitable foundations
* Established by-laws against oppression, provided aid to cities affected by calamity
* Treatment of Christians: executed Justin at Rome and Polycarp at Smyrna; failed in duty to ensure fair hearing for them

**Marcus Aurelius' Perception of Roman Religion:**
* Lack of moral teaching in Roman religion
* People paid sacrifices and rites for gods' favor, regardless of right or wrong
* Two dominant schools: Stoicism and Epicureanism

**Stoicism:**
* Founded by Zeno, born in Cyprus (likely between 350-250 B.C.)
* Influenced by Eastern and Western cultures
* Ideal: repression of emotions
* Aspired to suppress emotions but resulted in contrasting behaviors over time.

#### Stoicism: A Philosophical Overview and Key Concepts

**Casaubon Version 8.16**

**Stoicism: Origins and Key Figures**
- **Casaubon's Research**: studied under cynic Crates, explored various philosophical systems
- Established own school in Athens at "Painted Porch" or Stoa (280–207 B.C.)
- **Chrysippus**: key figure, organized Stoicism into a system, known as the School of the Porch

**Key Concepts and Beliefs**
- Live consistently: live in conformity with nature
- Threefold division of philosophy: Physics, Logic, Ethics
- Materialism with pantheistic elements
  - Universe = God, manifestation of spiritual force
  - Soul is an emanation from the godhead
  - Divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good

**Stoic Logic: The Criterion**
- Compared newborn soul to a sheet of paper
- Senses write impressions (φαντασίαι), experience leads to general notions or anticipations (κοινάε έννοιαι)
- Impressions that are irresistible are called "kataleptiké phantasia" or a perception proceeding from truth.

#### Stoic Ethics: Virtue, Happiness, and the Ideal Wise Man

**Stoic Philosophy:**
- **Highest good**: virtuous life, happiness; vice is unhappiness
- No gradations between virtue and vice
- Only virtue is good, vice is bad
- Indifferent things: health, wealth, pleasure, etc.
  - Wise Man is sufficient unto himself in all things
  - Knowing these truths brings happiness
- Ideal of Wise Man vs. actual attainment
  - Later Stoics: preferable and undesirable things
  - Certain actions are proper but neither virtuous nor vicious
- Things within our power vs. things not within our power
  - Desire, dislike, opinion, affection are within our power
  - Health, wealth, honor generally not within our power
- Stoic call to control desires and affections
- Unity of the universe and man's duty as part of it
  - Public spirit: political virtue in ancient world
  - Cosmopolitanism: Christians taught to be members of worldwide brotherhood.

#### Comparing Stoic and Christian Philosophy on Self-Control

**Stoicism vs. Religious Feeling in Marcus Aurelius' Meditations**

**Marcus Aurelius**:
- Not a head of a school, no body of doctrine
- Philosophy is more "religious feeling" than intellectual inquiry
- Uncompromising sternness softened by reverent, tolerant, gentle nature
- Grim resignation transformed into mood of aspiration
- Records innermost thoughts for self-help with moral maxims and reflections

**Comparison to Imitation of Christ**:
- Ideal of self-control in both
- Roman's temper is self-reliance, Christian aims at passive mood, humility, meekness, reliance on God
- Roman scrutinizes faults with severity but without self-contempt, Christian also values contempt for worldly things
- Both value men's praise/blame as worthlessness, but Christian appeals to God's censure while Roman appeals to own soul
- Both view petty annoyances with magnanimity, but Christian sorrows more for others' malice than own wrongs

**Marcus Aurelius vs. Christian Perspective**:
- Roman's virtue of suffering is not the focus in Meditations

**Marcus Aurelius' Meditations - Book IV**

**Quotes from Marcus Aurelius:**
- "There is, who without so much as a coat; and there is, who without so much as a book, doth put philosophy in practice." (XXV. I)
- "What art and profession soever thou hast learned, endeavour to affect it, and comfort thyself in it; and pass the remainder of thy life as one who from his whole heart commits himself and whatsoever belongs unto him, unto the gods: and as for men, carry not thyself either tyrannically or servilely towards any." (XXVI)
- "Consider in my mind ... the times of Vespasian: thou shalt see but the same things: some marrying, some bringing up children, some sick, some dying, some fighting, some feasting, some merchandising, some tilling, some flattering, some boasting, some suspecting, some undermining, some wishing to die, some fretting and murmuring at their present estate, some wooing, some hoarding, some seeking after magistracies, and some after kingdoms." (XXVII)
- "Those words which once were common and ordinary, are now become obscure and obsolete; and so the names of men once commonly known and famous, are now become in a manner obscure and obsolete names. Camillus, Cieso, Volesius, Leonnatus; not long after, Scipio, Cato, then Augustus, then Adrianus, then Antoninus Pius: all these in a short time will be out of date, and, as things of another world, become fabulous." (XXVIII)

**Key Concepts:**
- The importance of practicing philosophy in daily life despite circumstances
- Focusing on one's proper constitution and carrying yourself accordingly in every business to avoid being tired or vexed
- The transience of human affairs and worldly possessions, as time passes, names and people become obscure.

**Meditation on Mortality and Reality**

**The Nature of Existence**:
- All things are subject to change and alteration

**Achieving Simplicity**:
- Surrendering to fate and accepting that everything is natural or necessary

- Cultivating a just mind and charitable actions

**The Illusion of Suffering**:
- Evil only exists in the mind; it cannot persist outside of one's own perception
- The body is like a coat or cottage for the soul
- Judging oneself based on external circumstances (e.g., physical suffering) is misguided

**Observing Reality**:
- Wise men are afraid of their own fears and desires, not the actions of others
- True wisdom lies in understanding that good and evil only exist in our perception, not in reality.

**Meditation of Marcus Aurelius - The Fifth Book**

**Marcus Aurelius' Meditations**:
- Tr. Casaubon
- Available at www.philaletheians.co.uk
- Page 38 of 128

**The Fifth Book**

**Morning Reflections**:
- Unwilling to rise
- Remind yourself that you are stirred up to go about a man's work
- Ask yourself if you were born and brought forth into this world for this, or to lay in bed and make much of yourself in a warm bed
- Consider the nature of all things in the world - how they are intent on performing what is necessary for the preservation of the orderly universe
- You should also perform your part in this orderly universe by being busy and in action
- Nature has allowed you certain rest, eating, and drinking - but you go beyond this stint and come short of what belongs to a man
- If you truly loved yourself, you would love your nature and the end that it proposes

**Rest and Tranquility**:
- It is easy for a man to put off turbulent adventitious imaginations and be in perfect rest and tranquility

**Confidence in Action**:
- Speak or do anything that is according to nature, undervaluing yourself not to be discouraged by reproach or report
- If it is right and honest, you should not be discouraged by the opinion of others
- The rational overruling part and proper inclination of others are their own - you should focus on your own particular and common nature, which leads in one direction.

#### "Marcus Aurelius' Self-improvement Advice"

**Marcus Aurelius' Meditations - FIFTH BOOK**

**Natural Course of Life**:
- Continue life by natural actions until end
- Breathing, earth, and water provided sustenance
- All things in the world are used freely for various ends

**Admiration and Abilities**:
- No man can admire me for sharp language due to natural disability
- There are many other good qualities I can develop: sincerity, gravity, laboriousness, contempt of pleasures, being content with little, kindness, freedom, avoiding superfluity and vain prattling, magnanimity
- I can perform many things despite natural indisposition
- I am not constrained to murmur, be base or wretched, flatter, accuse, please, or be giddy and unsettled in thoughts
- I might have been rid of these defects long ago if only contented with being somewhat slow and dull

**Retaliation and Gratitude**:
- Some people seek retaliation for good deeds
- Others do not require retaliation but know what they have done
- Others may not even remember their actions
- Like a vine bearing fruit, I should focus on doing good deeds without expecting recognition or commendation

#### "Fate, Physician, and Destiny: A Philosophical Reflection"

**Understanding Socially Sensible Actions**
- Some argue that a rational man should understand what he does
- This is based on the assumption that sociable actions require sensitivity from both parties involved
- The author argues that this understanding does not hinder sociable actions
- Some individuals are led by a probable appearance of reason, similar to the Athenians' prayer for rain

**The Form of the Athenians' Prayer**
- Praying for rain was done freely and universally, not just for personal gain
- The phrase "O rain, rain, good Jupiter, upon all the grounds and fields that belong to the Athenians" reflects this concept

**Nature's Prescription**
- Comparison made between a physician prescribing remedies and nature ordering events
- What happens to an individual is considered as "ordained unto him as a thing subordinate unto the fates"
- This idea is shared by idiots who say "This his destiny hath brought upon him"

**Embracing Difficult Times**
- Accepting prescribed remedies from physicians, despite their harshness, is comparable to accepting the events that befall us
- We do this in hope of recovery or improvement.

#### Marcus Aurelius: Embrace Life's Challenges for a Philosophical Existence

**Principles of Acceptance and Contentment**
* Fulfilling things determined by nature are beneficial for personal health and universal welfare
* Be pleased with what happens as it contributes to the good of the universe and Jove's happiness
* Nothing unfavorable would have occurred if not contributing to the universe's good
* Acceptance of our own nature and proper administration leads to peace and continuity in life

**Discontentment and Disappointment**
* Avoid discontentment, disappointment, and despair when things do not go as planned
* Return to philosophy after setbacks instead of being displeased with worldly distractions or human infirmities
* Philosophy requires nothing more from us than what is natural and desirable
* Comparing philosophy to relief for physical ailments: return to it as a source of comfort and guidance.

#### Marcus Aurelius' Reflections on Universal Interconnectedness and Individual Responsibility

**Discussion on Gods' Deliberation and Human Life**

**Background:**
- Discussion of whether gods deliberate on human lives
- If they do, humans must accept their decisions as wise and discrete beings
- If not, humans are bound by consequences of universal deliberation

**Arguments Against Gods Deliberating:**
- It is hard to believe in an imprudent god
- No profit for gods or universe from causing harm to humans

**Human Deliberation:**
- Humans should deliberate on what is most profitable for themselves and society
- Profitability defined by individual constitution and nature
- Expedient things for the whole are expedient for each individual

**Conclusion:**
- What happens to any one person is also expedient for the whole.

#### "Marcus Aurelius on Contentment and Perspective"

**Meditations by Marcus Aurelius**

**Expedient Things**:
- The word "expedient" should more generally be understood as those things that are "middle things" or "things indifferent" - e.g., health, wealth, etc.

**Perception of Reality**:
- The ordinary shows of the theater and other such places affect us; when seen repeatedly in the same fashion, they become ingrateful and tedious.
- All things in the universe are still the same, from the same causes.
- When will there be an end?

**Contemplating Death**:
- Consider the deaths of men of all sorts, professions, and nations - including great orators, philosophers, heroes, captains, kings, scholars, and scoffers of human life.
- These individuals, even those with no name remaining, are no worse off than they were in life.
- The one thing worth pursuing is to converse with false and unrighteous men according to truth and righteousness, meekly and lovingly.

**Finding Joy**:
- Reflect on the gifts and virtues of those you daily converse with - their industry, modesty, liberality, etc.
- These resemblances and parallels can bring great joy.

**Gratitude for Small Blessings**:
- Do not grieve that you weigh less than desired; be grateful for what you have.

#### Meditations: Overcoming the Fear of Death by Marcus Aurelius

**II. The Joys of a Simple Life**
- It is more comfortable for a man to depart from this world having lived an honest life, clear of falsehood, dissimulation, voluptuousness, and pride
- If this cannot be achieved, it is better to joyfully depart than to desire to live and continue in wicked courses
- Experience should have taught one to avoid the "plague" of corruption of the mind, which is greater than any physical illness
- This is a plague of creatures as living beings, but the plague of men as rational beings

**III. Accepting Death with Patience**
- One should not carry themselves scornfully towards death, but as one well pleased with it as a natural part of life
- Just as we accept the natural processes of growing old and dying, we should also accept death as nature's operation
- A wise person should patiently wait for death, just as they would expect a child in the womb to be born
- Death is not something to be feared if one has lived a virtuous life, as it is only a change of state and not an end to existence

**IV. Sinning Against Oneself**
- Those who sin are harming themselves by making themselves worse than they were before
- Not only those who commit sins, but also those who omit something, can be unjust

**Using One's Self**:
- Use yourself even in things you despair of
- Your left hand, which is usually idle, has more strength than your right when used

**Meditation Objectives**:
- Consider what kind of person we should be at death
- Reflect on the shortness of life and the vastness of time
- Contemplate the frailty of material objects
- Consider the efficient causes, proper ends, and references of all actions
- Understand that pain is in itself, pleasure is in itself, and death is in itself
- Realize that everyone is the true ground of their own rest and tranquility, with no hindrance by others
- See through the conceit and opinion of external appearances.

#### Marcus Aurelius' Philosophy on Life and Fate

**Marcus Aurelius' Meditations: Twelfth Book**

**IX. Acceptance of Natural Events:**
- Gods or Fate: not responsible for misfortunes, either absolute necessity or flexible providence
  * If absolute necessity, why resist?
  * If flexible providence, make oneself worthy of divine help and assistance
- Confusion without moderator: reason to congratulate oneself if carried away by the flood
  * Mind and understanding cannot be carried away

**X. Understanding Fate:**
- Absolute necessity or unavoidable decree: no need to resist
- Placable and exorable Providence: make oneself worthy of divine help
- Mere confusion: reason to congratulate oneself, but mind and understanding cannot be carried away

**XI. Perception of Sin:**
- What do I know if someone has sinned?
  * They have already condemned themselves
- Comparison: wanting others not to sin is like wanting moisture in a fig or children to weep

**XII. Understanding Others' Actions:**
- Scratching and tearing one's own face when seeing someone sin is an object of compassion, not anger.

#### "Marcus Aurelius' Advice on Life and Death"

- If not true, do not speak it
- Maintain your purpose and resolution free from compulsion and necessity

- Reflect on your current state of mind: fear, suspicion, lust etc.

- Take away your opinion to find calm and stability
- Like a ship in a safe harbor, all things are capable of change

**V. The Nature of Suffering:**
- No operation can truly be said to suffer any evil as long as it exists
- Death is not hurtful because it is natural, expedient, and seasonable for the whole

#### Meditations on Life's Impermanence and Interconnectedness

**Three Key Concepts:**
1. **Living in accordance with Divine Providence**:
   - Importance of aligning one's will and mind with divine ordinance to be led by God
   - Being divinely inspired or led (θεοφόρητος)
2. **Contemplating the Impermanence of Things:**
   - Reflecting on the nature of actions, chance vs. providence, and the transience of all things
3. **Letting Go of Opinion**:
   - Recognizing that all things happen according to the nature of the universe and not getting overly attached or grieved by external factors
4. **Understanding Our Connection with All Beings:**
   - Acknowledging that every man's mind comes from the same source and no one truly owns anything
5. **Reflecting on Humanity's Commonality**:
   - Recognizing our kinship with all men, regardless of blood or seed, but through shared mind
6. **Contemplating Past Indignations:**
   - Reflecting on people who were once moved by strong emotions like honor, calamity, hatred, or fortune

**Additional Thoughts**:
- Letting go of opinions hinders us from being safe and finding peace within ourselves.
- Recognizing that the present moment is all we truly have.

#### The Nature of Everything: True Happiness and Intellectual Soul

**Reflections on Gods' Existence**
- All earthly possessions become insignificant: smoke or ashes
- Examples of vehement pursuit in worldly matters (Fabius Catulinus, Lucius Lupus, Stertinius, Tiberius at Capreae, Velius Rufus) are now mere fables
- True philosophy lies in carrying oneself with justice and moderation
- Proud claims of not being proud are the most intolerable form of pride

**Questions Regarding Gods' Existence**
- Some question the existence of Gods, ask how one knows they exist
- Response:
  - Gods are visible and apparent through daily experience of their power and providence
  - Even though we have not seen our own soul, we respect and honor it
  - We know the Gods exist based on their effects on ourselves and others

**Happiness in Life**
- True happiness comes from knowing the true nature of all things: what they are and what their form is
- Strive to do what is just and speak the truth at all times
- Continuous good actions lead to enjoyment of life, even if interrupted by small interruptions

**Unity of Reasonable Minds**
- Just as there is only one light from the sun, despite interceptions
- There is only one common substance in the world, divided into various bodies
- There is only one common intellectual soul, divided among individual minds
- Unity and correspondence between reasonable minds cannot be intercepted or confined to particulars like other common things.

#### Meditations on the Impermanence of Life - Marcus Aurelius

**Meditations of Marcus Aurelius - Twelfth Book**

**What do you desire?**
- To live long: enjoy sensitive soul, appetitive faculty, growth, decrease, talk, think, reason
- Desire worth in itself or follow God and reason
- Grieving deprivation of these things is against God and reason

**Reflection on Life's Transience**
- Small portion of infinite eternity allowed to us
- Quickly vanishes into the general age of the world
- Common substance, common soul: small allotted portion in a little clod of earth
- Conform to common nature for peace of mind

**Understanding and Contemplation**
- Present state of understanding is all that matters
- Other things are beyond our control
- Death as contemptible as pleasure or pain
- Life as citizen: lived according to city's laws and orders
- Equivalent to acting in a play with three acts
- Time for acting belongs only to the one who causes dissolution.

**Embracing the Present Moment**
- Go forth well pleased and contented, as he who dismisses us.
