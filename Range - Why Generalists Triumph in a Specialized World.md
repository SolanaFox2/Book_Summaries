### INTRODUCTION Roger vs. Tiger

**Nikolay's Father and His Exceptional Son**

**Nikolay's Early Development**:
- Balanced on father's palm at 6 months old
- Dragged a putter around at 7 months
- Climbed down from high chair to swing a golf club at 10 months
- Played golf with Bob Hope on TV at 2 years old
- Entered first tournament and won at 3 years old
- Learned how to play out of a "sand twap" at 3 years old
- Shot 48, eleven over par for nine holes at 4 years old
- Father could drop him off at golf course at 9am and pick him up 8 hours later

**Father's Belief in His Son**:
- Felt his son was singularly talented
- Convinced he was uniquely equipped to help him
- Had been an outstanding athlete himself
- Played baseball in college as the only black player
- Served in Vietnam as a Green Beret and taught psychological warfare
- Believed he had been given a second chance with his fourth child

**Father's Approach**:
- Quizzed the boy, teaching him to give short answers
- Helped him handle the media attention
- Didn't mind that his son beat him at 8 years old

#### The Unconventional Journey of a Tennis Prodigy

**Story of a Famous Person's Early Life**

**Background:**
- Son became famous at Stanford
- Father saw great potential, compared to Mandela, Gandhi, Buddha
- Widely varied sports participation from an early age
  - Kicked ball with mother when learning to walk
  - Played squash with father on Sundays
  - Tried skiing, wrestling, swimming, skateboarding, basketball, handball, tennis, table tennis, badminton
- Parents encouraged diverse sports involvement
- No pushy or overbearing parents

**Child's Interest in Sports:**
- Became unbearable if had to stay still for long periods
- Preferred games with a ball
- Loved to play and have fun

**Parental Support:**
- Mother didn't coach him due to his unusual strokes and lack of focus on the game
- Father's rule: "Just don’ t cheat"
- Focused more on tennis during teenage years

**Competitive Nature:**
- Competed in matches
- Preferred playing with friends for fun

**Misunderstandings:**
- Misquoted in local newspaper interview, said "more CDs" instead of "Mehr CDs" (Swiss German)

**Transition to Focus on Tennis:**
- Other kids had already started working with strength coaches, sports psychologists, and nutritionists
- He finally gave up other sports to focus solely on tennis.

#### The Drive for Early Specialization: The Tiger Woods Phenomenon

**Tiger Woods and Roger Federer:**
- In 2006, both were at the peak of their tennis/golf careers
- Tiger flew to attend the U.S. Open final
- Federer won for the third year in a row; they became friends
- Discussed feeling of being "invincible"
- Contrasted backgrounds: Tiger's parents were supportive, Roger's was not

**Tiger Woods:**
- Dominated golf like no other
- Childhood did not seem to hinder his development
- Ranked number one in world at midthirties
- Engaged in "deliberate practice" from an early age
- Symbolizes the idea that quantity of deliberate practice determines success
- Focused narrowly on golf from a young age

**Deliberate Practice:**
- Occurs with explicit instructions, individual supervision, immediate feedback, and repetition of tasks
- Elite athletes spend more time in highly technical, deliberate practice than those who plateau at lower levels
- Ten-thousand-hour rule: the idea that accumulated hours of specialized training is the sole factor in skill development

**Expertise Development:**
- Early focus and specialization become increasingly important as world becomes more complex
- Best-known icons of success, like Mozart and Mark Zuckerberg, are elevated for their precocity and head start.

#### Late Specialization as Key to Elite Sports Performance

**Cancer Specialization Trends**
- Oncologists no longer specialize in cancer but rather in cancer related to a single organ
- Trend advances each year
- **Atul Gawande**: Doctors joke about left ear surgeons, "we have to check to be sure they don't exist"
- British government failing to follow Tiger Woods path of unwavering specialization

**British Sports Development Programs**
- Moving high-ranking officials between departments is absurd like rotating Tiger Woods from golf to baseball to football
- British government's success at recent Summer Olympics due to programs that recruit adults to try new sports and create a pipeline for late developers
- **Slow bakers**: officials behind the program described athletes as slow to develop

**Elite Athletes vs. Near-elites**
- Elite athletes spend more time on focused, deliberate practice than near-elites
- Studies show eventual elites typically devote less time early on to deliberate practice in their chosen activity
- Instead, they undergo a "sampling period" where they play a variety of sports in an unstructured environment
- Later, they focus and ramp up technical practice in one area
- **Late specialization** is the key to success for elites
- Studies show this approach applies to individual sports, team sports, soccer, hockey, volleyball, etc.

**Criticism and Denial**
- Critics argue this may be true for some sports but not others
- Soccer community was particularly vocal in denying the findings
- **German Study**: Members of the German national soccer team were typically late specializers who didn't play organized soccer until age 22 or later
- Skilled hockey players at age 11 improved more by participating in more sports and non-organized soccer, not just more practice/training

#### The Advantages of Diverse Career Paths

**The Necessity of Hyperspecialization vs. Diversity in Sports**

**Introduction:**
- Roger vs. Tiger path to sports stardom:
  - Roger: Multi-sport participation and focus on school
  - Tiger: Hyperspecialization from a young age
- Quieter stories of athletes who followed the "Roger path"

**Examples:**
1. Super Bowl 2018: Tom Brady (baseball) vs. Nick Foles (multi-sport)
2. Ester Ledecká: First woman to win gold in two sports at Winter Olympics
3. Vasyl Lomachenko: Record for fewest fights needed to win world titles in three weight classes
4. Importance of early sampling and diversity

**Research Findings:**
1. Early career specializers vs. later specializers: Earnings lead but catch up by finding work that better fits skills and personalities
2. Technological inventors: Increased creative impact through accumulation of diverse experiences
3. Artistic creators: Similar finding as technological inventors
4. Successful individuals in various fields: CEO, artist, inventor who thrived due to range of experiences and interests

**Conclusion:**
- Research shows that diversity in experiences is beneficial for success, especially in long-term careers.

#### The Benefits and Misconceptions of Late Specialization in Career Changes

**Research on Specialization: Career Changes and Late Blooming**

**Background:**
- Speaker researched specialization in work beyond sports
- Audience consisted of military veterans, late specializers, and career changers
- Most were anxious about their career transitions
- Pat Tillman Foundation provided scholarships for career changes

**Findings:**
- Enthusiasm for change but fear of being labeled as "dangerous" or off-track
- Formed connections with others in similar situations
- Relief after hearing speaker's talk on the benefits of late specialization
- Invited to give keynote speech and small group gatherings

**Impact:**
- Career changes can be met with fear and uncertainty
- Transitioning from one career to another may lead to feelings of relief
- Late bloomers may face societal pressure to conform to linear progression
- Importance of personal experiences and leadership development

**Additional Findings:**
- Highly credentialed experts can become narrow-minded
- Learning is most effective when done slowly, leading to lasting knowledge
- Falling behind in the short term results in better long-term progress.

#### The Dangers of Over-Specialization in Modern Life

**Effects of Overspecialization**
* Individuals:
  * Mark Zuckerberg's statement about young people being "smarter" (1)
    * Contradicted by research showing older founders have better chances for successful start-ups (2)
  * Average age of fastest-growing tech company founders was forty-five (3)
* Systems:
  * Segregation within big banks leading to catastrophic consequences (4)
    * Specialization resulting in perversity during the 2008 financial crisis (5)
      * Incentivizing lower mortgage payments for homeowners, only to seize their homes later (6)
  * Healthcare professionals overspecializing and using inappropriate treatments (7)
    * Interventional cardiologists overusing stents despite evidence against it (8)
* Scientific research:
  * Increasing specialization creating a "system of parallel trenches" (9)
    * Researchers in different fields not collaborating or sharing knowledge effectively.

#### The Advantages of Delayed Specialization

**The Scientist's Vision for Despecialization**

**The Scientist's Approach**:
- Attempting to despecialize the training of future researchers
- Hopes it will spread to every field
- Profited from cultivating range in his own life
- Now broadening his purview again, designing a training program
- Believes this may be the most important thing he will ever do

**The Author's Personal Experience**:
- Felt unmoored and worried about making a mistake when pursuing a writing career after working in science research
- Never expected his path to go through work as an overnight crime reporter at a New York City tabloid, then becoming a senior writer at Sports Illustrated
- Worried he was a "job-commitment-phobic drifter" who was doing the career thing wrong
- Learning about the advantages of breadth and delayed specialization has changed how the author sees himself and the world

**The Relevance of this Research**:
- Applies to every stage of life, from child development in math, music, and sports, to students fresh out of college trying to find their way
- To midcareer professionals in need of a change and would-be retirees looking for a new vocation
- The challenge is how to maintain the benefits of breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes and demands hyperspecialization
- We need more people with range who can embrace diverse experiences and perspectives as complexity increases

### CHAPTER 1 The Cult of the Head Start

**Laszlo Polgar's Quest to Raise Geniuses**

**Background:**
- Laszlo Polgar born in Hungary after WWII, lost family due to Holocaust
- Determined to have a family and make his children geniuses
- Studied biographies of legendary thinkers for inspiration

**Meeting Klara:**
- Met in 1965, proposed marriage in 1967
- Both agreed education system was frustratingly one-size-fits-all

**Raising a Chess Champion:**
- Daughter Susan's first genius pursuit: chess
- Inspired by Bobby Fischer's victory against Boris Spassky in 1972
- Taught "pawn wars" and advanced study of endgames, opening traps
- Quickly caught on and won Budapest girls' championship at age six

**Home Education:**
- Decided to educate Susan at home from an early age
- Focused on chess training alongside regular education

**Impact:**
- Susan did not lose a game until she was six years old
- Read, wrote and was ahead in math by the same age
- Polgar's methods gained attention for their success in raising a child prodigy.

#### "The Polgar Sisters: Chess Geniuses Raised by Dedication and Early Specialization"

**The Polgar Family's Chess Prodigies**

**Background:**
- Hungarian police threatened to jail Laszlo for not sending daughter to compulsory school system
- Months of lobbying Ministry of Education for homeschooling permission
- Daughters Susan, Sofia, and Judit became part of grand experiment in chess training

**Early Life:**
- Girls attended gym by 7 a.m., played table tennis with trainers
- Back home for breakfast before long day of chess
- Laszlo hired coaches when reaching limit of expertise
- Cut recordings of game sequences from chess journals for study

**Achievements:**
- Susan: first woman to qualify for men's world championship (1986), became grandmaster at 21 (1991)
- Sofia: international master, peak ranking
- Judit: youngest grandmaster ever, male or female, at 15 years and 5 months (1993)

**Impact:**
- Polgar sisters won women's Chess Olympiad in 1988
- Competed internationally after communism fell
- Inspired countless articles, books, TV shows, talks as example of success through early start

**Cultural Impact:**
- Online course "Bring Up Genius" promoting Polgar method for personal success
- Mentioned in bestseller "Talent Is Overrated" as evidence of power of deliberate practice.

#### Naturalistic Decision-Making vs Heuristics in Expert Performance

**Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM) Model of Expertise**
- Pioneered by psychologist Gary Klein
- Observers expert performers in their natural environment
- Identifies patterns and instinctive decision making

**Chess vs. Other Activities**
- Chess and golf used as examples, but how representative are they?
- Many human activities may follow similar pattern recognition

**Expert Performance**
- Experts in various fields make decisions quickly based on patterns
  - Garry Kasparov: chess grandmaster recognizes winning move instantly
  - Firefighting commanders recognize burning building patterns
  - Naval commanders identify potential threats

**Heuristics and Biases Model of Human Judgment**
- Psychologist Daniel Kahneman's findings contrast Klein's
- Experience does not always lead to expertise or improved decision making
- Case study: young lieutenant assessing Israeli Defense Forces officer candidates
  - Duties included getting team and pole over six-foot wall without touching ground
  - Predictions based on leadership qualities, but performance was no better than blind guessing.

#### Expertise vs Experience in Wicked Learning Environments

**Experience and Expertise:**
- **Kahneman**: marveled at disconnect between statistical information and compelling experience of insight
- Influential book on expert judgment impressed Kahneman: showed experience did not create skill in many real-world scenarios
  - Human behavior domains (college administrators, psychiatrists, human resources) where patterns do not clearly repeat
  - Chess, golf, and firefighting are exceptions
- Debate between Kahneman and Klein on whether experience leads to expertise: depends on the domain in question
  - Narrow experience makes for better chess, poker players, and firefighters
  - Not for predictors of financial or political trends or employee/patient performance

**Kind vs. Wicked Learning Environments:**
- **Klein**: identified two types based on whether learning environment is kind or wicked
- **Kind learning environments**: patterns repeat, feedback is accurate and rapid
  - Golf, chess: player observes consequence, attempts to correct error, engage in deliberate practice
- **Wicked learning environments**: rules are unclear or incomplete, repetitive patterns not obvious, feedback delayed or inaccurate
  - Experience can reinforce wrong lessons (typhoid fever diagnosis example)

#### "Computers vs. Humans: Strategy Over Tactics"

**Effects of Changing Environments on Experts:**
* Few learning environments are as wicked as described, but small changes can disrupt experienced professionals (firefighters, chess masters)
* Expertise can become obsolete with the shift in status quo
* IBM's Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997 chess match
	+ Computers evaluate positions faster than humans and are tactically flawless
	+ Kasparov recognized Moravec's paradox: machines excel at tactics, humans at strategy
* Advanced chess tournament in 1998 paired human players with computers
	+ Humans focused on strategy while machines handled tactics
	+ Resulted in a more significant role for human creativity and strategic thinking
	+ Kasparov's advantage in calculating tactics was neutralized, creating parity between humans and machines.

#### "The Rise of Centaurs: Human-Computer Chess Duos"

**Freestyle Chess Tournaments**
* First freestyle chess tournament held a few years after Kasparov vs. Deep Blue (1997)
* Teams could include humans and computers
* Lifetime-of-specialized-practice advantage obliterated in freestyle
* Amateur players with three normal computers destroyed Hydra, best chess supercomputer
* Human/Computer teams ("centaurs") reached highest level of chess ever seen

**Centaurs' Victory over Hydra**
* Symbolized something more interesting: humans doing what they do best without years of specialized pattern recognition
* 2014 Freestyle Chess Tournament: $20,000 prize money for human/computer teams
* Winning team consisted of four people and several computers
* Captain Anson Williams (British engineer) no official chess rating but well-versed in computers
* Team member Nelson Hernandez: "Freestyle involves an integrated set of skills that have nothing to do with playing chess"
* Willsiams was a teenager prodigy at real time strategy game Command & Conquer
* Freestyle chess: consider advice from teammates and chess programs, then direct computers to examine possibilities
* Played cautiously, expecting a draw but trying to set up situations for opponent's mistake

**Kasparov vs. The Computer**
* Kasparov figured out a way to beat the computer: by outsourcing tactics (the most easily replaced human expertise)
* In 2007, Susan Polgar tested for National Geographic TV: perfectly re-created midgame chessboard diagram from truck on sidewalk in front of her.

#### "The Power of Chunking in Memory and Expertise"

**Chess Experiments and Chunking:**

**Background:**
- Dutch chess master Adriaan de Groot's experiments in the 1940s on memory skills using chessboards
- Grandmasters exhibited superior recall, but not photographic memory
- Chase and Simon (Carnegie Mellon University) repeated De Groot's experiment with an addition:
  - Players were presented with unfamiliar board configurations

**Findings:**
- Elite players, like grandmasters, do not possess photographic memories
- Instead, they use "chunking" to remember chess patterns
- Chunking: Grouping pieces into smaller, meaningful units based on familiar patterns

**Expertise and Superhuman Abilities:**
- Elite athletes seem to have superhuman reflexes due to pattern recognition
- However, these abilities disappear outside their specific contexts

**Everyday Chunking:**
- We all use chunking in skills we are expert at
- Example: Remembering words in a meaningful sentence vs. isolated list
  - Familiar patterns make it easier to remember information

**Conclusion:**
- Chunking is an essential cognitive process for remembering and recognizing patterns within various domains.

#### Mastery Through Repetition: The Power of Chunking in Chess

**Chess Mastery through Chunking and Repetitive Practice**

**Importance of Early Specialization**
- Critical for chess players to reach international master status by age twelve
- Drop in competitive players reaching this level from one in four to one in fifty-five without rigorous training early on.

**Chunking and Extensive Practice**
- Repetitive practice essential for chess mastery
- Chunking: storing information as a whole, rather than individual parts
  - Seems like "magic" but comes from extensive practice

**Savants and Islands of Genius**
- Individuals with insatiable drive to practice in one domain, ability far outstrips others
- Documented feats of savants like pianist Leslie Lemke: seemingly limitless retrieval capacity
  - Not human tape recorders, but rely on repetitive structures and patterns for extraordinary recall ability

**AlphaZero Chess Program**
- Advances in AI chess programs with AlphaZero's self-learning capabilities
- Played itself a garantuan number of times to improve and learn strategies
- Beats previous chess programs that used brute processing force to calculate moves.

#### AI's Limits: Human Intuition and Adaptability in Strategy Games

**AI vs. Human Intelligence: The Centaur Advantage**

**Chess and Go**:
- AlphaZero outperformed top chess programs in a short time
- Also beat the best Go players

**Shift to Open World Strategy**:
- Humans excel at big-picture strategy
- Computers struggle with complex decision making

**StarCraft**:
- Requires more complex thinking than chess or Go
- Computers initially struggled, but humans adapted

**AI's Limits**:
- In narrow worlds, humans may have less to contribute
- However, in open-ended games and real-world problems, humans still outperform AI

**Exponential Progress of AI**:
- In closed, rule-bound systems like chess, AI has made significant progress
- Challenges remain in more complex, open-world problems

**IBM Watson**:
- Failed to live up to expectations in open-ended fields like cancer research
- Struggling to pose the right questions is a major challenge for AI in these areas

#### The Limits and Pitfalls of Machine Learning and Expert Systems

**Google Flu Trends**:
- Report in Natur e journal in 2009 claimed Google Flu Trends could predict winter flu spread more rapidly and accurately than CDC
- In 2013, Google Flu Trends predicted over double the prevalence of flu in the United States compared to actual occurrence
- Now no longer publishing estimates, only a holding page saying "it is still early days" for this kind of forecasting

**Limitations of AI Systems**:
- AI systems are like **savants** - they require stable structures and narrow worlds
- When rules and answers don't change over time (e.g., chess, golf, playing classical music), they can be hyperspecialized
- However, these models are poor for most things humans want to learn
- When combined with an unfamiliar domain, the human tendency to rely on experience of familiar patterns can backfire (e.g., expert firefighters in unfamiliar structures)

**Expert Consultants**:
- Highly effective at solving well-defined and quickly assessed problems (like business school problems)
- Employed **single-loop learning**, favoring the first familiar solution that comes to mind
- When their solutions went wrong, they became defensive

**Psychologist Barry Schwartz's Study**:
- Gave college students a logic puzzle that could be solved in 70 different ways (hitting switches to turn light bulbs on and off)
- Students who found a solution repeatedly did so, even if they had no idea why it worked
- New students discovered the general rule for all 70 solutions more easily than experienced students who had been rewarded for a single solution

#### Variety in Learning: Varying Challenges for Cognitive Flexibility

**Compared to Golf: Tennis and Beyond**
* Tennis is more dynamic than golf, with players adjusting every second to opponents, surfaces, and teammates
* Tennis is less extreme than a hospital emergency room where doctors and nurses need to learn beyond practice and adapt to changing circumstances
* The world is not always like golf or tennis - it can be "Martian tennis" where the rules are unfamiliar and subject to change

**Misconceptions about Skill Development**
* Tiger's story and the Polgar example give a false impression that human skill develops in a perfectly supportive learning environment
* Massive early, specialized practice does not guarantee innovative performance or the development of grandmaster-like intuition
* Savants do not necessarily become "Big-C creators" who change their field
* Narrow expertise can lead to cognitive entrenchment, where experts have difficulty adapting to new rules or contexts

**Varying Challenges and Cross-Disciplinary Skills**
* Varying challenges within a domain and having "one foot outside your world" can help avoid cognitive entrenchment
* Scientists are more likely than others to have artistic hobbies, with Nobel laureates being particularly diverse in their interests
* Successful experts belong to the wider world and develop skills beyond their specialized domain.

#### Exploring Creative Crossover and Adaptability in Professional Success

**Creativity and Aesthetic Interests**

**Santiago Ramón y Cajal's Observation:**
- Creative individuals appear to be scattering and dissipating their energies from afar, but they are actually channeling and strengthening them.

**Importance of Aesthetic Interests for Creativity:**
- Lack of aesthetic interests outside a narrow field impedes creative contribution.
- Broad interests support insights not attributable to domain-specific expertise alone.

**Examples of Creative Achievers:**
1. Steve Jobs: Calligraphy class influenced design aesthetics in the Macintosh computer.
2. Claude Shannon: Philosophy course led to fundamental insight for computer technology.

**Successful Transitions and Range:**
- Broad training allows for successful transitions between careers.
- Keeping multiple "career streams" open fosters adaptability and creativity.
- Avoiding cognitive entrenchment is crucial in a wicked world with ill-defined challenges.

**Implications:**
- Embrace diverse interests to foster creative problem solving and adaptability.
- Maintain an open mind to new experiences and analogies for innovative solutions.

### CHAPTER 2 How the Wicked World Was Made

**The Town of Dunedin and James Flynn's Discovery**
- **Dunedin**: New Zealand city on a hilly peninsula, known for its steep residential street and university
- **University of Otago**: Oldest university in New Zealand, home to James Flynn
- **James Flynn**: Professor of political studies who changed how psychologists think about thinking
- Intrigued by IQ test scores of American soldiers in World War I and II
- Found that WWII soldiers performed better than WWI soldiers
- Wanted to know if civilians had experienced similar improvements
- Received data from Dutch researcher on Raven's Progressive Matrices test
- Noticed large gains in IQ for young Dutchmen between generations
- Collected data from fourteen countries and found the same trend: huge gains for children and adults.

**The Flynn Effect**
- Global pattern of increasing correct IQ test answers with each new generation in the twentieth century
- Documented in more than thirty countries
- Initially noticed by Flynn as an outsider, not accepted by psychometrics experts
- Other academics had previously encountered the same data but did not investigate it as part of a global pattern.

#### Flynn Effect: Unprecedented Growth in Abstract Reasoning Skills

**Improvements in Cognitive Ability (Flynn Effect)**

**Background:**
- Discovery of significant increase in cognitive ability scores over time: 3 points every 10 years
- Adult scoring average today would be in the 98th percentile compared to a century ago

**Impact and Perspective:**
- Revelation shocked researchers studying cognitive abilities
- APA meeting convened on the issue
- Flynn published findings in 1987

**Findings:**
- Improvements not explained by education or nutrition
- Impact most prominent on abstract reasoning skills
- Younger generations excel at extracting rules and patterns
- Greater improvement seen on less expected tests (Raven's Progressive Matrices)

**History:**
- Late 1920s to early 1930s: Socioeconomic changes in Soviet Union
- Individual farmers in Uzbekistan cultivated gardens and cotton
- Herders kept animals in mountain pasturelands of Kyrgyzstan

**Implications:**
- Unexpectedly large yet particular change in cognitive abilities
- Modern environment may contribute to improved problem-solving skills.

#### Transformation of Russian Villagers' Cognitive Processes in Post-Revolution Era

**Impact of Soviet Revolution on Rural Population:**
* Illiterate population in rural areas
* Enforced hierarchical social structure through strict religious rules
* Socialist revolution dismantled traditional way of life overnight
* Collective farms established, industrial development began
* Economy became interconnected and complex
* Farmers had to form collective work strategies
* Remote villages communicated with distant cities
* Network of schools opened in regions with 100% illiteracy
* Adults learned matching symbols to sounds
* Concept of numbers as abstractions introduced
* Villagers had used numbers before, but not for abstract thinking
* Some women remained illiterate but taught kindergarteners
* Classes offered on preschool education and agriculture
* Secondary schools and technical institutes established

**Alexander Luria's Study:**
* Recognized fleeting "natural experiment" in 1931
* Remote villages not yet touched by societal transformation
* Learned local language, engaged villagers in relaxed situations
* Discussed questions or tasks to discern habits of mind
* Simple task: describe and sort skeins of wool/silk
* Collective farmers easily described colors, formed groups
* Remote villagers refused to sort, said "it can't be done"
* Sorting based on color saturation observed in a few cases.

#### Abstract Reasoning and Modernity: A Study on Remote Villagers

**Remote Villagers vs. Modern Individuals:**

**Understanding Abstract Concepts:**
- Remote villagers struggled with abstract concepts like "shapes" (triangles, rectangles, circles) due to lack of formal education and exposure.
- Differed in perception based on practical narratives from their daily lives.

**Grouping Task Exercises:**
- Villagers reverted to practical experiences for grouping tasks.
  - A boy must stay with adults (Rakmat).
  - Tools are useless without a log (Hammer, Saw, Hatchet, Log).
  - Bird/Rifle/Dagger/Bullet: bullet must be loaded and used together to kill the bird and cut it up.
- Could not grasp reasoning based on abstract concepts.

**Modern Individuals vs. Remote Villagers:**
- Modern individuals can practice "education" and work out guiding principles from given facts or materials.
- Remote villagers lacked this ability due to limited exposure to abstract thinking.

**Abstract Designs and Optical Illusions:**
- Remote villagers were not susceptible to certain optical illusions experienced by industrialized world citizens (Ebbinghaus illusion).
- Modernity and collective culture enable new ways of thinking that may seem "magical" to those less exposed.

#### The Impact of Modernity on Perception and Abstract Thinking

**Perception and Modernization:**
- **Industrialized World vs Traditional Societies**: industrialized people perceive one circle as bigger than the other (right), while traditional societies see them as identical or have difficulty distinguishing between them.
- **Premodern People**: miss forest for trees; struggle with holistic context and abstract thinking
- **Modernization's Impact on Perception:**
  * Teenagers in modernized traditional societies: generate arbitrary groups, change frequently, but have superior recall and abstract thinking skills
  * Engagement with modern institutions: construct meaningful thematic groups, rely less on concrete experiences for understanding reality
- **Scientific Spectacles**: we make sense of the world through classification schemes and layers of abstract concepts instead of direct experiences.
- **Examples**:
  * Animals classified as mammals with detailed connections based on physiology and DNA
  * Words like "percent" that represent concepts previously understood only by scholars becoming widely used
  * Computers: progress bar represents time estimation for immense underlying activities
- **Lawyers**: results of one case can be relevant to another despite different contexts (company vs individual, Oklahoma vs California).

#### Cognitive Flexibility: Adapting Minds to Modern Work

**Preparation Techniques:**
- Hypothetical arguments: predicting opposing attorney's perspective
- Flexible conceptual schemes
  * Arranging information for various uses
  * Transferring knowledge between domains
- Modern work demands cognitive flexibility

**Impact of Conceptual Schemes:**
- Connecting knowledge and making it accessible
- Adaptation to complexity: profound implications

**Cognitive Flexibility:**
- Correlated with exposure to modern work
- Utilitarian spectacles vs. premodern worldview

#### The Evolution of Modern Thinking: From Categorical to Abstract

**Akhmetzhan's Questions:**
- **Understanding white bears**: Where they come from?
- **America**: Governed by us or another power?

**Siddakh's Questions:**
- **Personal improvement**: How to make kolkhozniks better people?
- **Plant growth**: Obtaining bigger plants, growing trees
- **Global understanding**: Where things come from, how rich became rich, poor are poor.

**Modern Mind vs Premodern Life:**
- Modern minds are comparatively free to explore ideas across domains
- Luria's "categorical thinking": Flexible, able to shift between attributes and construct categories
- Flynn's disappointment: Society pushes specialization instead of early conceptual learning

**Flynn's Study:**
- GPAs vs critical thinking test results: No correlation for most majors
- Students performed well on basic conceptual reasoning but poorly on transferable knowledge applications
  - Biology, English, Psychology, Science, Neuroscience, Business all struggled outside their fields
  - Econ majors did best due to broad field nature.

#### Higher Education: A Narrow Focus on Specialization?

**Flynn's Findings on College Education:**
* Flynn found that students from various majors struggled to apply scientific reasoning outside their field
* Students often mistaken value judgments for scientific conclusions and failed to distinguish correlation from causation
* Students had difficulty generalizing research methods from their own field to others
* Flynn concluded that colleges do not develop critical intelligence, focusing instead on narrow specialization
* Education at top universities does not prepare students to analyze the modern world beyond their discipline
* Criticism extended to Flynn himself, as he recognized his own tendency to bury broad concepts in specific class information
* Departments prioritize developing student expertise within a narrow field over sharpening their thinking skills
* Flynn argues that students must be taught to think critically before being taught what to think about.

**Flynn's Personal Experience:**
* Flynn had a rigorous education at the University of Chicago, including cross-country team captainship
* He criticizes universities for not developing critical intelligence and general problem-solving skills beyond specialized fields
* Flynn recognizes his own tendency to focus on specific class information instead of broad concepts during teaching.

#### The Dangers of Narrow Vocational Training in Science Education

**The Need for Broad Understanding in Education**

**Problem:**
- Students attend classes with a narrow focus on specific disciplines
- Lack of understanding of fundamental principles and critical thinking skills
- Limited application of knowledge to real-world situations

**Solution:**
- Encourage broad education focused on critical thinking and scientific reasoning
- Adopt the concept of "computational thinking" as mental Swiss Army knife

**Examples of Broad Education Programs:**
- University of Washington's "Calling Bullshit" class (INFO 198/BIOL 106B)
- Advocacy for computational thinking by Jeannette Wing, computer science professor at Columbia University

**Effects of Lack of Broad Understanding:**
- Students end up in careers unrelated to their major
- Limited use of a single tool for complex issues

**Personal Experience:**
- Flynn's passion for scientific reasoning resonated with the writer's experience
- Graduate student's lack of understanding of statistics and its limitations led to incorrect results in research.

**Quotes:**
- Jeannette Wing: "Computational thinking is using abstraction and decomposition when attacking a large complex task."
- Arnold J. Toennere: "No tool is omnicompetent."
- Bryan Caplan: "Three-quarters of American college graduates go on to a career unrelated to their major."

**Historical Context:**
- The writer's personal experience of committing statistical malpractice during graduate studies.

#### The Importance of Broad Thinking for Modern Problem-Solving

**The Importance of Fermi Thinking**

**Fermi Problems**:
- Example: "How many piano tuners are there in New York City?"
- Designed to challenge students' ability to reason and estimate, rather than relying on prior knowledge
- Named after Enrico Fermi, who used similar back-of-the-envelope estimates

**Benefits of Fermi Thinking**:
- Helps approach problems with limited information
- Allows making reasonable guesses even with inaccurate individual estimates
- Can be applied across domains and improved through training

**Fermi Thinking and Learning**:
- Provides a way to leverage limited knowledge to investigate the unknown
- Allows for conceptual reasoning skills, which are crucial in rapidly changing world
- Contrasts with specialized thinking that relies on prior experience only

**The Need for Broad Training**:
- Automation will take over repetitive and constrained challenges
- Great rewards will accrue to those who can apply knowledge across new problems and domains

### CHAPTER 4 Learning Fast and Slow

**Lesson Topics:**
- **Learning Algebraic Expressions: Understanding Variables and Evaluating Expressions**
- **Concepts:** Variables, Substitution, Evaluating expressions

**Introduction to Algebraic Expressions:**
- Teacher explains the concept using an Eagles game and hot dogs as motivation
- Students learn about variables (representing undetermined numbers)
  - Example: Three dollars for each hot dog = Three N (N represents number of hot dogs)
- Importance of understanding variables in math progression

**Understanding Variables:**
- Variables can be represented by any letter
- Students may find it confusing initially
- Teacher explains the concept using examples
  - Cost of hot dogs: Three N, where N represents number of hot dogs
  - Earnings from working hours: Seven H (H represents hours worked)

**Evaluating Expressions:**
- Substituting a number for a variable in an expression
- Students practice evaluating expressions with given examples
  - Replace N with specific numbers to find results
    * Three dollars for each hot dog = Three N, evaluate N as two: Six dollars
    * Hours worked and earnings: Seven times H hours = Seven H dollars.

**Confusion Among Students:**
- Questions arise regarding the use of variables and substitution in expressions
  - student asks if it must always be a single number for each example?
  - Teacher clarifies that variables can represent any number or value once defined as such.

**Connection to Realistic Contexts:**
- Difficulty arises when applying concepts to realistic contexts (social studies class length vs math class length)
- Students struggle with understanding the abstract nature of variables and evaluating expressions in new situations.

#### Classroom Question Types and Their Impact on Student Achievement

**Understanding Variable Expressions**
- Students struggle to understand variable expressions during a math lesson
- Teacher presents examples and asks students to transform phrases into variables
  - "Six less than a number?" (incorrect: "Six minus N")
  - "Fifteen less than B?" (incorrect: "B less than fifteen")
  - Student, Patrick: "Fifteen over B" (correct)
- Students guess answers based on multiple choice options or by combining expressions
- Teacher mistakes students' rote memorization of answers for productive exploration

**Observations in Classrooms Around the World**
- Variability in teaching styles and classroom environments observed across different countries
  - Netherlands: students often late, individual work
  - Hong Kong: similar to US classrooms
  - Countries used real-world problems vs symbolic math
  - Some classes kept students seated, others allowed approach to blackboard
  - Teachers ranged from energetic to staid
- Despite differences, one consistent finding was the use of two main types of teacher questions:
  - "Using procedures" questions: practice on recently learned skills.

#### The Effect of Teaching Style on Problem-Solving in Mathematics Education

**Study Techniques: Making Connections vs Procedure Practice**

**Formula for Sum of Interior Angles of a Polygon:**
- Calculate using formula: 180 × (number of polygon sides − 2)
- Apply to various types of polygons

**Types of Questions:**
1. **Making Connections**: Connects students to broader concepts
2. Procedure Practice: Focuses on executing a specific procedure

**Observed Behavior in Classrooms:**
- Teachers often respond to making-connections problems with hints, turning them into procedure practice
- In the US, 1/5 of questions started as making-connections but all were changed by interaction
- Japanese classrooms maintained half of making-connections problems for conceptual exploration
- Teachers in every country sometimes fell into this trap, but higher performing countries kept more making-connections problems

**Impact on Learning:**
- Students seek hints to turn conceptual problems into procedural ones for expediency
- Importance of procedure practice, but focusing solely on it can hinder learning concepts
- In Japan, classrooms engaged in collective problem solving with chalkboard writing (bansho) to track conceptual connections.

**Conclusion:**
- Procedure practice is essential, but a balanced approach that includes making connections is crucial for effective math training.

#### Desirable Difficulties: Benefits of Struggle in Learning Process

**Impact of Relying on Procedures in Learning Mathematics:**
- Students often rely on memorized algorithms for problem solving (Richland's research)
- Example: students' understanding of fractions based on algorithms instead of conceptual reasoning
  - Only 15% of students used conceptual reasoning to get the correct answer
  - Some students unlearned number sense, like adding two numbers gives a third comprised of the first two
- Students may have been taught procedures as a quicker or easier way to understand concepts (parents and teachers)

**Impact of Desirable Difficulties on Learning:**
- Making learning challenging can enhance long term progress
- Excessive hint-giving can undermine progress in the long run
- Three rigorously supported methods for enhancing learning: generation effect, practice, and retrieval practice.

**Generation Effect:**
- Struggling to generate an answer on your own enhances subsequent learning (even if it's wrong)
- Eighth grade math teacher unintentionally subverted this method by providing answers too easily.

#### The Power of Mistakes in Learning: Monkey Experiment and Generation Effect

**Generating Answers Improves Learning**

**Socrates' Approach**:
- Generated answers rather than being given them
- Requires intentionally sacrificing current performance for future benefit

**Kornell and Metcalfe's Experiment**:
- Tested 6th graders in the South Bronx on vocabulary learning
- Varied how students studied to explore the "generation effect"
- Students given definitions first performed better than those given words and definitions together

**Hypercorrection Effect**:
- The more confident a learner is of their wrong answer, the better the information sticks when they subsequently learn the right answer
- Allows for "big mistakes", which can create the best learning opportunities

**Primate Learning Experiment**:
- Kornell and colleagues studied rhesus macaques (Oberon and Macduff) learning lists of random pictures
- Provided hints during practice, either automatically or upon request
- After training wheels were removed, monkeys had a "performance disaster" without hints

#### The Science of Deliberate Practice and Spaced Repetition for Long-Term Learning

**Macduff vs Oberon's Performance:**
* Macduff got less than one in five lists correct on day one with no hints
* Improved steadily each training day
* On test day, Oberon scored almost three-quarters of the no-hint lists
* Macduff got about half of them

**Experiment Results:**
* More hints during training = better performance during early practice but worse on test day
* No hints = slow learning process but lasting results

**Testing for Learning:**
* Testing, including self-testing, is beneficial for learning
* Even testing before studying works
* Struggling to retrieve information primes the brain for subsequent learning

**Spacing in Learning:**
* Intuitive sense of focusing on one topic at a time
* Importance of deliberate not-practicing between bouts of deliberate practice
* Harder it is, the more you learn
* Space between practice sessions creates hardness that enhances learning.

#### Efficient Learning Strategies: Spacing, Testing, and Connection-Making

**The Effect of Spacing on Learning**

**Spacing Effect**:
- Group that studied Spanish for 8 years retained 250% more than those who studied it continuously for the same amount of time
- Spacing makes learning more productive by making it harder, which can improve recall

**Short-Term vs. Long-Term Memory**:
- Subjects who were able to reproduce Spanish words immediately after hearing them performed best
- Subjects with 15 seconds of rehearsal before reciting came in second
- Subjects distracted with math problems recalled the least, but transferred information from short-term to long-term memory when given a pop quiz

**Importance of Struggling**:
- Repetition is less important than struggle in learning
- Progress too quickly can lead to a "knowledge mirage" that evaporates over time
- The most efficient learning in the long run can be inefffective in the short run

**Overcoming Overconfidence**:
- If you are doing too well, the simple antidote is to wait longer before practicing the same material again
- Frustration is not a sign of poor learning, but ease is

**Learning Strategies**:
- The U.S. Department of Education identified spacing, testing, and using making-connections questions as effective learning strategies with scientific backing

#### Calculus Teaching Styles: Short-Term Success vs Long-Term Learning Outcomes

**U.S. Air Force Academy:**
- Cadets commit to serve as military officers for minimum of eight years after graduation
- Highly structured and rigorous academic program focusing on science and engineering
- Minimum of three math courses per year for every student
- Calculus I, II, and advanced math, science, and engineering courses

**Calculus Professor Impact:**
- Economists studied impact of professors on cadet performance
- Standardized test scores and high school grades evenly distributed among sections
- Same syllabus, exams, and evaluation forms used for each section
- Two groups of Calculus I professors identified: those promoting strong student performance (boosters) and those with lower impact (laggards)
- Boosters had fewer students passing Calculus I exam but performed better in long-term math and engineering courses
- Laggards had higher passage rates on Calculus I exam but underperformed their students in advanced classes
- Economists suggested booster professors facilitated "deep learning" through difficult, frustrating courses
- Students evaluated teachers based on short-term test performance rather than long-term benefits
- Long-term benefit of teachers was overlooked as students punished the most effective instructors in their evaluations.

#### Desirable Difficulties: How Challenges Improve Learning Over Time

**Impact of Teacher Experience on Student Performance**

**Findings**:
- Calculus I students performed better when taught by less experienced and qualified teachers
- Students struggled in Calculus I but did better in subsequent courses with more experienced and qualified teachers
- Similar pattern observed at Bocconi University: Teachers who guided overachievement in their own course undermined student performance long-term

**Desirable Difficulties**:
- Avoid interpreting current performance as learning
- Good test performance during the learning process may indicate mastery, but can also signal fleeting progress

**Education Trends**:
- Americans have increasingly believed current students receive worse education than they did in the past
- National Assessment of Educational Progress scores have risen steadily since 1970s
- Education goals have become more loftier as labor market demands shift towards problem-solving and group work

**Examples of Changing Education Needs**:
- Early 1980s: Basic skills test question focused on procedural knowledge (how long it takes to ride a bike)
- 2011: Problem-solving question (cost of items at snack bar)

#### Interleaved Learning Enhances Flexible Problem Solving

**Pretzel Cost Problem:**
- Cost of 1 pretzel: Not directly addressed in provided text
- To find cost, need additional information (price per pretzel)

**Relationship Between Concepts:**
- Formula "distance = rate × time" not applicable here
- Problem requires connection of multiple concepts for new situation

**Learning Strategies:**
- Blocked practice: repeated practice of same problem
  - Leads to excellent immediate performance
  - Limited flexibility and broad application
- Mixed or interleaved practice: practice different problems together
  - Improves inductive reasoning
  - Creates abstract generalizations
  - Enhances ability to apply knowledge to new material
- Research shows mixed practice leads to better results on tests compared to blocked practice.

#### The Power of Desirable Difficulties in Learning and Problem Solving

**Interleaving and Desirable Difficulties in Learning**

**The Feeling of Learning vs. Deep Learning**:
- The feeling of learning is based on "before-your-eyes progress"
- Deep learning is not as intuitive

**Interleaving as a Desirable Difficulty**:
- Interleaving is a desirable difficulty that holds for both physical and mental skills
- Piano students who mixed 8-, 12-, 15-, and 22-key jumps outperformed those who only practiced the 15-key jump
- In motor skill learning, interleaving improves the ability to match the right strategy to a problem

**Expert Problem Solvers vs. Kind Learning Environments**:
- Experts in less repetitive environments (e.g., chemists, physicists) evaluate and then choose a strategy
- In contrast, experts from kind learning environments (like chess masters) rely heavily on intuition

**Desirable Difficulties and Knowledge Stickiness**:
- Desirable difficulties like testing, spacing, making connections, and interleaving make knowledge sticky and durable
- However, they also make performance suffer in the short term
- This can be a problem because we often assess our progress based on current performance

**Fadeout Effect in Early Childhood Education**:
- Researchers found a "fadeout" effect where temporary academic advantages quickly diminished or vanished
- This may be due to the fact that early childhood education programs often teach "closed" skills that can be acquired quickly through procedural repetition

#### The Slow Learning Advantage: Mental Flexibility and Deep Understanding

**Early Skills Development: Fadeout vs. Lasting Benefits**

**Fadeout of Early Motor Skills:**
- Not a disappearance, but the rest of the world catching up
- Temporarily impressive but no evidence of long-term advantage for rushing development
- Research recommends focusing on "open" skills for lasting academic benefits
- Teaching kids to read early is not a lasting advantage

**Deep Learning vs. Head Start:**
- The slowest growth occurs in the most complex skills
- Parents and educators may overestimate impact on future learning
- Feedback from progress reinforces instinct to do more of the same, but it teaches the wrong lesson
- Learning deeply means learning slowly
- Cult of head start fails learners by focusing on surface-level skills rather than deep understanding

**Importance of Flexible Knowledge Structures:**
- Enduring utility requires flexible mental schemes
- Recognizing deep structural commonalities in problems facilitates far transfer
- Ability to apply knowledge effectively in new domains or novel situations is essential for long-term success.

### CHAPTER 5 Thinking Outside Experience

**The Seventeenth Century: Challenging the Celestial Model**

**Background:**
- The dominant view in the seventeenth century: celestial bodies moved around a stationary Earth, powered by individual spirits
- Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus proposed planets revolved around the sun but it was considered unorthodox

**Objections to the Established Model:**
1. Unexpected phenomena defied the model
   - New star in Cassiopeia (supernova)
   - Comets moving through the sky
2. Johannes Kepler's doubts and questions
   - Challenged two millennia of accepted wisdom
   - Accepted Copernican model but sought explanation for planetary motion
3. Kepler's Hypotheses:
   - Distant planets move slower due to weaker "moving souls" or force from the sun
   - One single force emanating from the sun, acting more powerfully on nearby planets
4. Analogies used for explanation:
   - Smells and heat dissipate predictably farther from their source
   - Unseen moving power like light
5. Precursor to Gravity:
   - Kepler used terms "power" or "force" instead of "soul" and "spirit"
   - Suggested a physical entity connecting planets to the sun, leading to the concept of gravity.

#### Kepler's Analogies in Unveiling Planetary Laws

**Kepler's Analogies in Understanding Planetary Motion**

**Background:**
- Kepler sought to understand planetary motion beyond light analogy
- No single explanation provided for all aspects of planetary orbits

**Analogy 1: Magnets (Planets as magnets with poles)**
- Planets attract/repel each other based on pole location near sun
- Explanation for slower movement at certain orbital distances

**Analogy 2: Sun's Rotation and Whirlpool of Power**
- Sun rotates, creating current that sweeps planets around
- Circular currents explain non-circular orbits
- Introduced concept of celestial bodies influencing one another

**Analogy 3: Boats in a Current (Planets steering through current)**
- Each planet can steer perpendicular to sun's current
- Explains why planets move in same direction and maintain orbits

**Analogies Galore:**
- Light, heat, odor, currents, boatmen, lenses, balance scales, broom, magnets, magnetic broom, orators, etc.

**Intellectual Wanderings:**
- Kepler's process of exploring new ideas and questioning existing ones
- Invention of astrophysics: laws for phenomena in the heavens

**Key Takeaways:**
- Kepler used analogies to understand planetary motion when traditional explanations failed
- His intellectual journey led him to invent astrophysics and discover laws of planetary motion.

#### Exploring Analogical Thinking: Kepler's Approach to Solving New Problems

**Kepler's Approach to Science and Analogical Thinking**

**Kepler's Contributions**:
- Filled the universe with invisible forces acting all around us
- Helped usher in the Scientific Revolution
- Documented his meandering thought process, providing a record of his creative transformation
- Thought outside the box by considering concepts beyond their immediate domain

**Analogical Thinking**:
- Recognizing conceptual similarities in multiple domains or scenarios
- A powerful tool for solving "wicked problems"
- Allows humans to reason through problems they have never seen in unfamiliar contexts
- Makes the new familiar, or the familiar new
- Examples:
  - Molecules and billiard ball collisions
  - Electrical principles and water flow
  - Biological concepts informing artificial intelligence (neural networks, genetic algorithms)

**Kepler's Analogical Reasoning**:
- Investigated "action at a distance" in the heavens by considering analogies such as:
  - **Odor, heat, light**
  - **Magnets, boats**

#### Strategies for Complex Problem Solving: The Malignant Tumor and the Fortress Riddle

**Problem Solving: Surface Analogies vs Novel Problems**
* **Surface Analogies**: Draw on past experiences to solve new problems
	+ Relied upon when solving "kind world" problems with repeating patterns
	+ Example: Fixing a clogged drain using previous experience
* "Kind World" Hypothesis
	+ Based on the assumption that surface analogies work for novel problems as well
	+ Limited to environments with similar experiences and repeating patterns
* Current World Requirements
	+ Need to solve abstract or relationally similar problems without relying on previous experience
	+ More important for creative problem solving

**Karl Duncker's Problem: The Malignant Tumor**
* Hypothetical problem from the 1930s posed by Karl Duncker
* Doctor faces a patient with a malignant stomach tumor that cannot be operated on
* A ray can destroy the tumor, but it will also harm healthy tissue if used at sufficient intensity
* Lower intensities are harmless to healthy tissue but ineffective against the tumor

**Solving the Malignant Tumor Problem**
* Unclear how to proceed as no solution provided in the text

**Story Interlude 1: Capturing a Fortress**
* General faces challenge of capturing a fortress in a foreign country with mines on roads
* Divides army into small groups, synchronizes their arrival at the fortress via separate roads
* Plan succeeds, general captures the fortress and overthrows the dictator

**Story Interlude 2: Fire Chief and the Woodshed Fire**
* Small-town fire chief arrives at a woodshed fire that may spread to nearby houses
* Unresolved whether this story is related to the malignant tumor problem or not.

#### Analogies as Tools for Ill-Defined Problem Solving: The Impact of Multiple Domains

**Solving "Duncker's Radiation Problem"**

**Problem Solving**:
- Initial attempts to solve the problem using neighbors and buckets were unsuccessful
- Fire chief's approach of having everyone throw water at the shed simultaneously managed to extinguish the fire
- About 10% of people initially solved the radiation problem, but this percentage increased with additional information

**Analogical Thinking**:
- Giving participants analogies from different domains (e.g., fortress, fire chief) tripled the proportion of solvers who got the radiation problem
- Participants were not automatically able to apply the first analogy to the second problem, even in a psychology experiment

**Cautionary Tale**:
- Experience-based intuition is well-engineered for solving problems in familiar domains (Tiger domains)
- But can be less effective for ill-defined problems
- International relations students' reasoning was influenced by the first analogy presented (WWII vs. Vietnam), leading to different outcomes

#### Overcoming Bias through Analogous Problem-Solving

**Effects of Analogies on Problem Solving:**
* College football coaches differ in evaluating potential based on analogies (:)
* Successful strategies involve multiple, structurally similar situations
* Limitation of relying on a single analogy from a similar domain
* Inside view vs. outside view in problem solving

**Inside View:**
- Natural impulse to focus on details of current project
- Can be limiting and potentially disastrous (Kahneman's experience)
- Team underestimated high school curriculum project duration

**Outside View:**
- Probes for deep structural similarities in different situations
- Counterintuitive approach
- Ignore unique surface features of current project
- Look for structurally similar analogies instead.

**Effectiveness of Analogies:**
* Multiple analogies increase chances of finding solutions
* Outside view provides deeper understanding of problem structure
* Can help defeat natural inclination towards inside view thinking.

#### Overconfidence in Detailed Analysis: The Impact on Decision Making

**Experiment by Lovallo and Economists (2012)**
* Business strategy professor Dan Lovallo collaborated with economists to study decision-making and the outside view
* Recruited investors from large private equity firms for analysis of investment projects
	+ Detailed description of a project and its return on investment required
	+ Instruction to estimate returns for other similar projects
* Private equity investors overestimated their own project's return by approximately 50% initially
	+ Revised estimates after considering conceptual similarities
* Investors judged their own projects more favorably due to internal details knowledge (Lovallo, "Inside-view bias")

**Psychological Effects on Judgment**
* More internal details = more extreme judgments
* Individuals tend to overestimate the significance of specific scenarios
	+ Horse race: focus on horse's details leads to belief in victory
	+ Election: focus on politician's background leads to belief in win
* Students rated university higher when given specific department rankings
* Focusing narrowly on problem details can result in incorrect judgments (Bent Flyvbjerg, Major Programme Management at Oxford University)
* 90% of major infrastructure projects go over budget due to manager focus on project details and overoptimism.

#### "Leveraging Analogies for Accurate Movie Predictions"

**Project Management: Using Analogies for Accurate Forecasts**

**Project Managers as Curriculum-Building Team:**
- Ignored specifics of project and focused on others with structural similarities
- Believed their expertise would prevent delays like other groups

**Case Study: Tram System Project in Scotland**
- Outside consulting team went through analogy process
- Used analogies to separate projects, concluding cost projection was underestimated
- Tram opened 3 years late and exceeded £1 billion

**Analogical Thinking in UK Infrastructure Projects:**
- Forced managers to make analogies to many past projects
- Improved accuracy in forecasting project costs

**Movie Industry: Applying Analogical Thinking for Film Success Forecasting**
- Researchers gave moviegoers basic film information and asked them to score analogies between upcoming releases and forty older movies
- Predictions using moviegoer's analogies were more accurate than mathematical models based on seventeen hundred past films
- Netflix also adopted this approach for improving recommendation algorithm: instead of predicting what you might like, they examine who you are like.

**Importance of Analogical Thinking:**
- Can lead to accurate forecasts in various industries
- Improves decision making by comparing new situations with known ones.

#### The Power of Analogies in Problem-Solving and Strategy Development

**Analogies and Decision Making:**

**Importance of Using Multiple Analogies:**
- Business students who used one or more analogies generated more strategies than those given no analogies (Lovallo & Dubin)
- The more distant the analogy, the better for idea generation

**Intuitive Expert vs. Novel Problem Solving:**
- Intuitive experts rely on pattern recognition and extensive narrow experience
- Generating new ideas or facing novel problems with high uncertainty requires evaluating a array of options

**Analogy Usage among Business Students:**
- Most believed the best way to generate strategic options was to focus on a single example in the same field
- This approach is often wrong according to Lovallo

**Boston Consulting Group's Approach:**
- Created an intranet site with collections of materials for facilitating wide-ranging analogical thinking
- Interactive "exhibits" sorted by discipline, concept, and strategic theme.

#### "Leveraging Distant Analogies for Problem-Solving: The Ambiguous Sorting Task"

**Observational Strategies: Learning from Detailed Examples**
- Sherlock Holmes' observational strategies could inspire ideas for understanding complex problems
- An exhibit on Holmes' methods might provide insights for professionals in various fields

**Exploring Analogies and Deep Structures**
- Researcher Dedre Gentner investigated the ability to understand problems through distant analogies
- Created the "Ambiguous Sorting Task" with 25 cards describing real-world phenomena
- Participants sorted cards into categories based on domain (e.g., economics, biology) and deep structure (positive or negative feedback loops)
- Examples:
  - Economic bubbles and melting polar ice caps as positive-feedback loops
  - Sweating and Federal Reserve rate changes as negative-feedback loops
- Gas prices leading to grocery price increases and neuron message transmission are causal chains
- Students from the Integrated Science Program performed better at identifying common deep structures due to exposure to various scientific fields.

#### Kepler's Persistent Pursuit for Mars Orbit Accuracy

**Integrated Science Program (ISP)**
- Allows students to see connections across different disciplines
- Professionals from specific academic departments may not be supportive
    - Want students to take more specialized classes within a single department
    - Concerned about students falling behind
    - Prefer rushing students to specialization over fostering analogical thinking and conceptual connections

**Analogical Thinking and Problem Solving**
- Successful problem solvers can determine the deep structure of a problem before choosing a strategy
- Less successful problem solvers only classify problems by superficial, overtly stated features
- Effective problem solving begins with understanding the problem's context

**Kepler's Journey to Reimagine the Universe**
- Kepler struggled with understanding Mars' orbit as perceptions did not align with the accepted theory of circles within spheres
- Asked peers for help but was met with reluctance to challenge the established scheme
- Spent five years calculating Mars' position in the sky, only to discard his findings due to minor discrepancies
    - Decided to abandon his previous work rather than assume his model was correct and two observations were off by 8 minutes of arc.

#### "Analogical Thinking in Modern Research Labs: A Key to Breakthroughs"

**Kepler's Unconventional Insights**
- Kepler chose to challenge his model based on inconsistent observations (8 minutes)
- This led him to reevaluate the universe, reinventing astronomy
- Analogies played a crucial role in his new understanding: light, heat, smells, boats, brooms, magnets
- Characteristic of today's world-class research labs: openness to unexpected findings and analogies as guides

**Psychologist Kevin Dunbar's Observations**
- Studied molecular biology labs in the 1990s
- Witnessed productive labs at work, documenting the process of discovery
- Focused on genetics and viruses, particularly HIV treatment
- Observed weekly lab meetings with various teams (different sizes, genders)
- Recorded and analyzed creative moments, focusing on scientific breakthroughs
- Found that the most productive labs made numerous analogies from diverse base domains.

**Characteristics of Productive Labs**
- Open to unexpected findings
- Scientists make many analogies when dealing with inconsistencies or new information
- Diverse professional backgrounds lead to a wider range of offered analogies
- Breakthroughs are more reliably produced in such environments.

#### The Advantage of Diverse Perspectives in Problem-Solving

**Laboratory Collaboration and Analogical Reasoning:**
- **Kepler Labs**: diverse members with various experiences and interests
- Drawing on range for analogies: essential for solving complex challenges
  * Straightforward challenges: similar experiments as reference
  * Unusual challenges: distant analogies, deep structural similarities
  * Frequent use of new analogies during lab meetings (every 4 minutes)
  * Diversity in backgrounds leads to creative problem-solving
- Two distinct labs encountering the same problem
  * One used medical degree knowledge for solution
  * Other relied on E. coli expertise but struggled
- Dunbar's study: lack of new findings in a lab with similar members
  * All had backgrounds leading to limited analogies usage
  * Comparison to stock market: various strategies necessary

**Problems with Broad Education:**
- Integrated Science Program: offers a mixture of strategies but may discourage students from focusing on specific majors or careers early on.
- Importance of slowly acquired knowledge:
  * Helps match individuals to appropriate challenges
  * Not incentivized due to lack of entrenched interests.

- Art dealer boss criticized his drawings, claimed he was no artist

**Continued Struggle:**
- Enrolled in art school at age 32
- Lasted only a few weeks
- Fluctuated between artistic passions: realistic figures vs landscapes, realism vs expression

**Despite Failures:**
- Persevered with drawing as self-expression and exploration of truth.

#### "Van Gogh's Journey to Abstract Expressionism"

**Vincent van Gogh's Artistic Journey**

**Discoveries through Art**:
- Art was a medium for religious devotion one week
- Concerns of pure creation emerged the next
- Believed true art consisted only of shades of black and gray
- Later, embraced vibrant colors as the real "pearl" inside the artist's work

**Personal Experiences**:
- Fell in and out of love with various artistic experiments
- Dragged easel and oil paints to a sand dune during a storm, allowing him to paint freely
- Avowed and disavowed capturing sunlight in paint
- Obsessed over darker blacks in colorless works, then shifted to vibrant colors

**Inspiration and Influences**:
- Started piano lessons to learn about color tones
- Forsook goal of becoming a master draftsman
- Left figures with blank faces and "mittened" hands
- Used his "mind's eye" instead of live models or images to copy

**Transformation of Landscapes**:
- Observed the sky pass for hours from his bedroom window
- Transformed a nearby town into a tiny village on canvas
- Represented a dark green cypress tree as massive and winding up the canvas

#### Late-blooming Artists: Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Rowling

**Vincent van Gogh's Artistic Breakthrough**
- Van Gogh was on the brink of being relegated to a drawing class for ten-year-olds at age thirty-four, but his starry night painting and other works in a new style launched a new era of art and inspired new conceptions of beauty and expression.
- His paintings, once dismissed as experiments, are now among the most valuable objects in the world.
- Van Gogh gained recognition during his lifetime with ecstatic reviews and an exhibition declaration by Claude Monet, the dean of impressionism.
- His work has influenced modern art and inspired widespread devotion that no other artist or person has equaled.
- Van Gogh's paintings are now displayed in museums around the world, with record numbers of visitors, including at the Art Institute of Chicago.
- Despite this, if Van Gogh had died at thirty-four, he might not have merited a historical footnote.

**Paul Gauguin's Late Career Breakthrough**
- Paul Gauguin was a merchant marine worker before finding his calling as an artist in his thirties after the market crash of 1882.
- He switched to become a full-time artist at age thirty-five, similar to J.K. Rowling's late career success after failure.
- Gauguin's innovative style of synthetism, with bold lines and brilliant colors, also became one of the most valuable works in art history.

#### The Benefits of Delayed Specialization in Career Choice

**Late Developers and Exceptional Success**
- **Cherry-picking stories**: not exceptions due to late starts, but integral to their success

**Match Quality**
- Economists' term for fit between work and individual's abilities/proclivities
- Inspired by personal experience of Ofer Malamud
  * Moved from Israel to Hong Kong as a child
  * Attended English school with academic specialization requirements
  * Chose not to specialize, instead sampled various fields before settling on economics and philosophy

**The Role of Education in Delaying Specialization**
- Theodore Schultz argued that education allows individuals to delay specialization
  * Increases worker productivity through higher education
  * Provides information about match quality

**Study on Timing of Specialization: England vs. Scotland**
- English and Welsh students had to specialize before college, limiting opportunities for sampling
- Scottish students were required to study different fields first two years of college, allowed more time for sampling
- Early specialists had more domain-specific skills but less knowledge of match quality
- Late specialists had fewer skills but greater understanding of abilities/interests

**Findings: Late Specialization vs. Early Specialization**
- English and Welsh students were consistently more likely to switch to unrelated career fields after college
  * Less information about match quality due to earlier specialization
- Despite starting behind in income, Scottish students quickly caught up

#### Exploration and Career Switching: Benefits Outweigh the Risks

**Benefits of Exploration vs. Early Specialization**
- Students in Scotland: less specialized early, more students changed majors to subjects not offered in high school (Malamud)
- English and Welsh students: earlier specialization led to more mistakes, fewer skills acquired due to limited exposure
- Adults in England and Wales more likely to divorce from careers settled on too early

**Switching and Career Satisfaction**
- Switchers experienced higher growth rates after switching, regardless of when they specialized (Malamud)
- Study by Steven Levitt: Job changers who flipped heads (decided to switch) were happier six months later than those who stayed in their jobs
- Admonitions like "never give up" may be poor advice if it means staying in a bad fit (Levitt)

**Importance of Informed Switching**
- Teachers tend to leave poorly matched schools and improve student performance after switching (Kirabo Jackson)
- Exploration is crucial for finding the best match, even if it means changing paths.

#### Predicting Dropout Risk: The Role of Grit in Military Training

**Psychologist Angela Duckworth's Study on Quitting**

**Background:**
- Duckworth studied dropping out of U.S. Military Academy's basic training (Beast Barracks)
- Contradicts adages about quitting and modern psychology concepts

**Participants:**
- 1,218 incoming freshmen with high academic, athletic achievements, and nominations from Congress
- Some dropouts despite Whole Candidate Score's inability to predict them

**Grit Assessment:**
- Designed by Duckworth to measure passion and perseverance
- Consisted of self-assessments on work ethic, resilience, and consistency of interests

**Findings:**
- Whole Candidate Score failed to predict Beast dropouts
- Grit Scale was better at identifying potential dropouts
- Work ethic and resilience important for completing rigorous training programs.

#### Grit's Limits: Selection Bias in High-Performance Contexts

**Grit Research Findings and Limitations**

**Duckworth's Extensions of Grit Concept**:
- Studied grit in Scripps National Spelling Bee
- Found that both verbal IQ tests and grit predicted speller's performance
- High grit and high verbal IQ were best, but lower grit could be compensated by high verbal IQ
- Popularization of grit led to increased testing and assessment in various domains (sports teams, Fortune 500 companies, etc.)

**Limitations and Criticisms**:
- Duckworth expressed concern about the misuse of high-stakes character assessment
- Grit research may have limited external validity due to study populations being highly preselected (West Point cadets)
- Other factors like physical fitness, grades, and leadership experiences may predict Beast persistence as much or more than grit in a truly random population sample
- Dropouts from West Point may not necessarily be negative; some cadets might make the decision to leave during Beast based on various reasons.

#### Career Exploration and Matching: Young Adults' Learning Process

**Military Academy Experience: Beast and Career Matching**

**Beast:**
- Challenging experience for physical cadets
- Some leave during first semester due to academic struggles or lack of fit
  * Homesickness or realization of misalignment with academy goals
- May lead to self-discovery and better career decisions

**Career Matching:**
- Modeled as a "multi-armed bandit process"
- Comparison between gambler and slot machines: testing various paths for maximum rewards
  * High risk, high informational value
- Young adults initially choose risky jobs with potential high reward
- Constant feedback and weed-out processes provide learning opportunities

**Quitting:**
- Seth Godin's perspective on quitting: valuable strategic advantage
- Quitting not because of difficulty but misalignment with goals or interests
  * Winners quit fast when a plan doesn't work out.

#### Military Training and Early Exits: A Dilemma for the Army

**Beast Barracks and Quitting the Military**

**Background:**
- Group of high achievers without military experience begin "high-risk, high-reward program" (West Point)
- Receive taxpayer-funded scholarships worth around $500k for five-year active duty commitment

**Retention Rates**:
- Half of West Point graduates leave after 5 years, as soon as they're allowed
- Only 25% stay until their early forties and earn a lifetime pension
- Company-grade officers have the lowest retention rates among all training programs

**Investment in Officer Training:**
- OCS trainees stay longest
- ROTC scholarship length correlates with shorter tenure
- West Point graduates and full-scholarship ROTC trainees leave earliest

**Implications:**
- Military sees West Point as "an institution that taught its cadets to get out of the Army"
- Concerns about developing career senior officers instead of just Beast survivors
- Misaligned investment strategy: More investment = higher likelihood of early departure.

#### The Army's Leaky Officer Pipeline: A Talent Mismatch in the Knowledge Economy

**The Army's Officer Pipeline Problem**

**Background:**
- Monograph written by major, retired lieutenant colonel, and colonel - all former West Point professors
- Identified problem as a "match quality conundrum" in the 1980s

**Industrial Era vs. Knowledge Economy:**
- In industrial era: highly specialized firms with employees tackling same challenges repeatedly
  * Culture of pensions and job security
  * Barriers to worker mobility
  * Employers looked inward for career opportunities
- Transition to knowledge economy: overwhelming demand for employees with conceptual skills
  * Shifted control over career trajectory from employer to employee

**The Army's Perspective:**
- Stuck with industrial-era ladder mentality
- Missed out on match quality markets
- Junior officers leaving the army not a loss of drive but a change in goals due to personal development.

**Impact of Knowledge Economy:**
- Efficient talent market rapidly emerged in private sector
  * Workers shift around in pursuit of match quality jobs
- Army missed out on this market mechanism

**Quotes from the Monograph Authors:**
- "There is no talent matching market mechanism" - junior officers leaving army signaled a change in goals, not a lack of drive.
- Ashley Nicolas: "I’ve yet to meet a classmate who left the Army and regretted it."
  * All grateful for experience despite not becoming a lifelong career.

#### "Grit and Career Flexibility: The Army's Shift in Approach"

**Adjustments to Army Personnel Management:**
* The Army has shifted from a rigid "up-or-out" model to embracing match flexibility
* Officer Career Satisfaction Program allows scholarship-ROTC and West Point graduates control over career progression
* Scholarship recipients commit to an additional 3 years of active service in exchange for branch and location choice
* The program has been successful, with 4,000 cadets extending their service commitments within the first 4 years
* Defense Secretary Ash Carter's pledge to reshape personnel management to allow officers more control over development
* Cadets expressed concerns about rigid career paths during a meeting with Defense Secretary Ash Carter in 2016.

**Personal Grit:**
* Intuitive appeal of grit research for the author, who identifies as having high levels of grit
* Author's experience as a walk-on athlete on a Division I college team
* Initially worst runner in team but persevered through 2 years of grueling workouts and ego-bruising races
* Learned about effective training methods and improved significantly, cracking the top ten university list, being All-East twice, and setting a university record with his gritty roommate.

#### Persistent Pursuit of Changing Interests: A Personal Account

**Athlete's Unusual Challenge and Difficulty:**
- Awarded Gustave A. Jaeger Memorial Prize for athletic success despite poor performance as a walk-on
- Head coach felt sorry watching workouts freshman year
- Approach to work: hardworking, not discouraged by setbacks
- Grit Scale assessment: 50th percentile among Americans
- Changed goals and interests frequently (political science instead of astronaut)

**Background:**
- Wanted to become a pilot and astronaut at seventeen
- Nominated for U.S. Air Force Academy
- Transitioned from science to journalism
- First job was as a midnight-shift street reporter in New York City

**Grit Scale Assessment:**
- Hard worker, not discouraged by setbacks
- Lacked consistency in goals and interests
- Changed career paths multiple times (science -> journalist)

**Importance of Grit for Young People:**
- Clear and measurable goals in sports
- Limited menu of choices for young people
- Passion and resilience are main challenges.

#### The Paradox of Persistence: Grit vs Creative Evolution in Art and Life

**Sasha Cohen's Advice Column for Retiring Athletes**

**Understanding Life's Differences from Sports:**
- Olympic athletes need to adapt to new challenges post-career
- Travel, write, start businesses, or engage in activities without clear goals

**Grit and Persistence:**
- Achieving single overarching goal every day builds grit, determination, and resilience
- Mental and physical preparation for competition differs from real life challenges

**Engagement at Work:**
- Gallup survey reported 85% of workers were not engaged or actively disengaged
- Quitting takes more courage than continuing in a failing situation (sunk cost fallacy)

**The Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
- Humans hesitate to walk away from investments, time, or money already spent
- Conmen exploit this tendency by asking for small favors before making larger requests

**Vincent van Gogh's Life and Work Ethic:**
- Intoxicated with the idea of persistent hard work and success
- Whipsawed interests, constantly devoting himself to various styles or mediums
- "Altered gospel" - changing passions over time
- Eventually found his unique style and creatively erupted.

#### Late Specialization and the Importance of Short-Term Planning in Career Development

**Van Gogh's Personality Traits:**
* Maniacal intensity in testing options
* Maximum information signal about fit
* Quickly moves to new goals or projects
* Lands in 40th percentile on Grit Scale: low sticking power but high work ethic

**Working with Veterans and the Pat Tillman Foundation:**
* Review applications for scholarships since 2017
* Inspiring essays from veterans, military personnel, and spouses
* Formative experiences lead to unexpected goals or talents
* Applicants join community of scholars, discuss late specialization as a catharsis
* Passion and perseverance important but change of interest is not a disadvantage
* Short-term planning essential for finding the best match.

#### Navigating Unconventional Career Paths: The Dark Horse Strategy

**Girl Scout Training Event and Unusual Career Paths**

**Hesselbein's Philosophy**:
- Carry a "big basket" to bring something home from every new experience
- Meandering path, not long-term plan
- Do what is interesting or needed at the moment

**Studying Unusual Career Paths**:
- Harvard researchers studied people who followed unusual career paths
- Recruited high fliers from various fields: sommeliers, personal organizers, animal trainers, etc.
- Found that most perceived themselves as "dark horses" on an unlikely path

**Characteristics of Dark Horses**:
- Focused on matching quality rather than falling behind others
- Short-term planning, not long-term vision
- Even those who appeared to have long-term vision were actually short-term planners

**Phil Knight's Perspective**:
- Nike cofounder Phil Knight said he initially wanted to be a professional athlete

#### Discovering One's Passion: Stories of Self-Discovery and Career Pivots

**Sports and Goal Setting: A Case Study on Phil Knight and Charles Darwin**

**Background:**
- Phil Knight's story: not good enough for college sports, found success in the shoe industry through goal pivots
- Standardization covenant: cultural notion of sticking to a rigid goal with head start for stability

**Phil Knight:**
- Ran track under a coach who became cofounder
- Did not set long-term goals, preferred self-exploration
- Learned from failures and applied lessons to next venture

**Ogas' Insights:**
- People fulfilled by pursuing long-term goals after discovery period
- Risky to commit early without knowing how goal fits you
- Path is not fixed, self-discovery is essential

**Charles Darwin:**
- Originally planned to be a doctor like his father wanted
- Found medical lectures "intolerably dull"
- Switched to botany and eventually found success in science

**Michael Crichton:**
- Started with medicine due to financial necessity
- Became disenchanted with practice, switched to writing
- Used medical education for storytelling in Jurassic Park and ER

**Conclusion:**
- Career goals can appear ludicrous when examined with self-knowledge gained through discovery.

#### The Evolution of Personal Preferences Over Time

**Personality Development and Change**

**Key Findings:**
- Our preferences and life choices do not remain constant
- People tend to underestimate future changes while overlooking past ones
- Dan Gilbert's "end of history illusion" phenomenon
- Personality traits change with age, but not perfectly correlating with previous personality
- Some studies suggest specific personality trait developments:
  * Agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and less neurotic in adulthood
  * Less open to experience during middle age
  * Slowing down but not stopping at any age

**Marshmallow Test:**
- Series of experiments starting in the 1960s
- Child given a marshmallow with promise of an additional one if they can wait for experimenter's return
- Experiment aimed to measure self-control and delayed gratification.

#### The Marshmallow Test: Predicting Lifelong Success Through Delayed Gratification

**Marshmallow Test Study Findings:**
* Children tested on ability to wait for maximum reward (15-20 minutes)
* Longer wait time linked to greater social, academic, financial success and less drug abuse later in life
* Media attention and DIY tests emerged as popular predictor of child's future
* Not all children who ate marshmallow turned out poorly
* Shoda argued that both nature and nurture influence personality development
* Studies demonstrated how specific behaviors can change with mental strategies or situations (if-then signatures)

**Marshmallow Test Results:**
* Most kids wait at least a little before eating the marshmallow
* Distraction methods used: looking away, shoving plate, covering eyes, singing, talking to themselves, counting, thrashing around
* Some children immediately consume both treats
* Crystal ball allure and misinterpretation of results

**Personality Development Debate:**
* Nature vs. nurture debate on personality roles
* Shoda's work bridged the gap between extremes
* Both nature and nurture influence personality development
* Context principle: individual behavior varies depending on situation.

#### The Evolving Nature of Personal Identity and Career Development

**Grit and Personality Evolution**

**Challenges of Long-term Goals**:
- Conscientiousness and neuroticism may not translate across contexts (e.g., playing Beatles covers vs. leadership)
- Past experiences and contexts do not fully represent future abilities and motivations

**Personality Changes with Time, Experience, and Context**:
- Personality traits can evolve as we encounter new situations (Alice in Wonderland's "beginning of my adventure" metaphor)
- Mid-career professionals may experience a desire for change, followed by transition and actual career switch

**Maximizing Match Quality**:
- We learn who we are through experiences, not just introspection
- Sampling activities, social groups, contexts, jobs, careers, and reflecting on personal narratives is key to maximizing match quality

#### "The Power of Short-Term Career Experimentation"

**Critique of Career Advice: Limitations of StrengthsFinder and Conventional Wisdom**
* Ibarra's perspective on career development: self-discovery through experience (Ibarra, personal communication)
	+ People want easy answers for ideal careers (Wall Street Journal article)
		- Clear picture of what you want before acting
	+ Critique of strengths-finder and conventional wisdom articles
		- Pigeonholing individuals and ignoring growth
		- Overemphasis on long-term plans
* Ibarra's argument for 'First act and then think': discovering possibilities by doing (Ibarra, personal communication)
	+ Numerous possibilities within each individual
	+ Learn who you are through experience, not just theory
	+ Extreme transitions: Pierre (Buddhist monk), Lucy (organizational development coach)
* Themes in career changes: feeling unfulfilled, chance encounters with new worlds, short-term experiments.

**Critique of Career Advice: Limitations of StrengthsFinder and Conventional Wisdom (Continued)**
* Ibarra's perspective on career development continues (Ibarra, personal communication)
	+ Cult of the head start
		- Belief that change should not be rash
	+ Confidants advise against changing plans
		- Keep new interests or talents as hobbies
	+ Career changers realize they need a change and begin short-term experiments.

#### "Test-and-Learn" Approach to Career Changes

**Career Transitions: A Test-and-Learn Approach**

**Advice for Career Changers:**
- Begin with temporary experiments, Hesselbein style
- Reflect on experiences and move to next short-term plan
- Be open to exploring various possible selves

**Ibarra's Recommendations:**
- Ask smaller, testable questions about your future self
- Don't commit to long-term plans but explore promising situations
- Adopt a test-and-learn approach instead of plan-and-implement

**Misconceptions About Geniuses:**
- Michelangelo did not have a clear vision from the start
- He constantly changed his mind and altered sculptural plans
- Test-and-learn approach is more realistic than premature optimization or fixed plans.

### CHAPTER 8 The Outsider Advantage

**Bingham's Discovery of Outsider Thinking**
- **Background**: Bingham specialized in organic chemistry for his PhD, but realized the importance of "outsider thinking" during graduate school
- **Eureka Moment**: Noticed clever solutions often came from unconventional knowledge (e.g., cream of tartar)
- **Questioning Conventional Wisdom**: Started wondering how to build an organization that embraces this kind of problem solving

**Attempting to Implement Outsider Thinking at Eli Lilly**
- **Presenting Problems**: Collected 21 problems stymieing Eli Lilly scientists and made them public
- **McKinsey's Response**: Agreed to the idea but expressed skepticism about external solutions
- **Confidentiality Concerns**: Scientists who contributed problems objected, fearing competition and trade secrets
- **Relaunching the Project**: Bingham persisted and the site was relaunched, with answers starting to come in during the U.S. anthrax scare
- **Outsider Solutions**: Strangers were providing solutions that had previously stumped Eli Lilly chemists

**Implications of Outsider Thinking**
- Bingham's experience highlights the value of diverse perspectives and unconventional knowledge in problem solving
- The idea that "outsider thinking" can lead to innovative and clever solutions, even in specialized fields, is intriguing.

#### The Advantage of Diverse Perspectives: A History of Unconventional Problem Solvers

**The Key to Solving Hidden Knowledge Puzzles: Outside Knowledge**

**Bingham's Experiment**:
- Validated hypothesis that outside knowledge is crucial
- Surprised by the "knowledge pockets" hidden in various domains
- Lawyer's submission was a successful molecular synthesis solution
- Saw parallels to chemical structure of needed molecule, even though tear gas not related to problem

**InnoCentive Company**:
- Spun off from Bingham's experiment as a separate company
- Facilitates "seekers" posting challenges and rewards for "solvers"
- Over one-third of challenges were completely solved
- Realized the importance of framing challenges to attract diverse solvers
- Coined term "outside-in" thinking: finding solutions in experiences outside focused training

**Historical Examples**:
- **Napoleon Bonaparte**: Offered reward for research on food preservation
- **Robert Boyle**: Failed to find solution, while confectioner **Nicolas Appert** succeeded
- Appert's wide-ranging culinary experiences gave him advantage over focused scientists
- Placed food in thick champagne bottles and boiled them for hours to preserve it

#### The Outsider's Advantage: Unconventional Solutions to Complex Problems

**Napoleon's Cannery and Canned Food Revolution**
- **Pierre-Samuel d'Appert**: Preserved a whole sheep in a crock to demonstrate the preservation of nutrients
- His method: Heat kills microbes, revolutionized public health
  - Scurvy went from deadly curse to avoidable nuisance
  - Main scientific epiphany (heat kills microbes) was not discovered until Louis Pasteur in 1860s
- English forces used Appert's method at Waterloo in 1815
- Critics underestimated outsiders' capabilities
  - Assumed it was a past achievement, wouldn't translate to specialization era
- **Alph Bingham**: Outside-in solvers' contributions outshined expectations
  - NASA struggled for 30 years to predict solar particle storms
  - Engineer Bruce Cragin solved challenge using radio waves within six months of submission
    - Previously collaborated with scientists, found specialist teams mired in details
    - Retired engineer thrived without specialist background

**Exxon Valdez Oil Spill and Outside-In Solutions**
- 1989: Exxon Valdez oil tanker hit a reef, leaked oil into Prince William Sound
- Challenges in removing oil from recovery barges after skimming it from water
  - Devilishly difficult due to low temperature and peanut butter-like consistency (chocolate mousse)
- 20 years later, 32,000 gallons of oil remained stuck along Alaska's coast.

#### The Unconventional Solution: Turning Construction Equipment into Chocolate Mousse Saver

**Scott Pegau's InnoCentive Challenge**

**Background:**
- Scott Pegau, research program manager at Oil Spill Recovery Institute, offered a $20,000 reward for solution to cleaning cold chocolate mousse out of recovery bars.
- Ideas came in but most were too expensive and impractical.

**John Davis' Solution:**
- Davis, a chemist, came up with a simple, cost-effective method.
- He drew inspiration from the problem of stirring a slushy drink.
- Reminisced about struggling to build concrete steps during previous work experience.

**Eureka Moment:**
- Witnessed the effect of a concrete vibrator on hardening concrete at the job site.
- Realized that vibrators could be used for cleaning the "chocolate mousse".

**Solution Details:**
- Diagrammed how to attach concrete vibrators to recovery bars.
- Total solution was only three pages long.

**Impact and Reflection:**
- Pegau saw it as an effective solution that might have been overlooked due to industry expertise.
- Davis' approach challenged traditional methods within the industry (Einstellung effect).

#### "Outsiders: Key Drivers in Modern Innovation"

**InnoCentive and External Solvers**

**Davis's Achievements**:
- Earned cash awards for solving hair removal product challenge and rolling chewing gum on his leg as a kid
- Able to frame problems with distant analogies from outside his field

**InnoCentive's Approach**:
- Works because specialists become more narrowly focused, leading to "Russian nesting dolls" of subspecialties
- Cragin and Davis were outside the box, seeing straightforward solutions that eluded insiders
- Solvers often bewildered when they overcame challenges stumping entire companies or industries

**Expertise vs. Innovation**:
- **Lakhani's Findings**: Problems further from a solver's expertise were more likely to be solved
- Traditional firms rely on hyperspecialized experts, but this can limit innovation
- "Big innovation often happens when an outsider who may be far away from the surface of the problem reframes the problem in a way that unlocks the solution"

**Outside-In Solvers**:
- InnoCentive demonstrated the concept, leading to other organizations capitalizing on outside solvers
- **Kaggle**: Specifically for machine learning challenges, with top-ranked solver Shubin Dai living in China

#### Pioneering Interdisciplinary Problem Solving through Cross-Domain Knowledge Integration

**Kaggle Competitions:**
- Dai's team processes data for banks but participates in Kaggle competitions to explore machine learning
- Favorite problems involve human health or nature conservation
- Importance of domain expertise: not crucial for winning competitions, creative solutions needed (Dai)
- Winners often have no medical/biology training and limited machine learning experience (Domingos)
- Knowledge can be a double-edged sword, hindering creativity

**Don Swanson:**
- Physics PhD in 1952, worked as an industry computer systems analyst
- Became dean of Graduate Library School at University of Chicago in 1963
- Concerned about increasing specialization and its impact on creativity
- Believed interdisciplinary problem solving was important, but subspecialties were becoming isolated (Swanson)
- Eleven neglected connections between magnesium deficiency and migraine research discovered by systematically cross-referencing public domain knowledge.

#### Olympic Sprinter's Genetic Mystery Solved by a Patient

**Migraine Prevention and Magnesium:**
- In 2012, American Headache Society and American Academy of Neurology reviewed research on migraine prevention and concluded magnesium should be considered as a common treatment (Swanson, J.)
- Evidence for magnesium was equivalent to that for ibuprofen (American Headache Society and American Academy of Neurology)

**Interdisciplinary Connections:**
- Swanson aimed to show hidden interdisciplinary connections in areas never overlapped before (Swanson, M.)
- Created computer system Arrowsmith to help users devise searches across diverse scientific articles (Swanson, M.)
- Specialization can lead to overspecialization and constrained problem solving (Lakhani, K.)
- Jill Viles: Olympic medalist and muscular dystrophy patient with the same mutation (Jill Viles)

**Migraine Prevention:**
- Magnesium considered a common treatment for migraines based on strong evidence (American Headache Society and American Academy of Neurology)
- Swanson's research focused on interdisciplinary connections in literature (Swanson, M.)
- Overspecialization can hinder problem solving; tapping outsiders with different approaches is key (Lakhani, K.)

**Jill Viles:**
- Thirty-nine-year old Iowa woman living with muscular dystrophy
- Discovered potential connection between her gene mutation and that of an Olympic sprinter
- Offered research findings in detail through email, including photos, medical history, and extensive documentation. (Jill Viles)

### CHAPTER 9 Lateral Thinking with Withered Technology

**Nintendo's Early History: From Hanafuda Cards to Innovation**

**Origins of Nintendo**:
- Founded in 1889 as a company selling hanafuda cards ("flower cards") in Kyoto, Japan
- Meaning of name uncertain; may have meant "leave luck to heaven" or just a way to sell hanafuda

**Challenges and Diversification**:
- By 1950, Nintendo had 100 workers, with the founder's grandson in charge
- Late 1960s: Adults turned to pachinko gambling and bowling, causing financial difficulties
- President invested in food products (instant rice, cartoon meals) and failed ventures (taxi fleet, "love hotels")
- Debt-ridden, president hired university graduates for innovation, but struggled to attract them

**Gunpei Yokoi's Joining Nintendo**:
- 1965: Hired a local electronics graduate named Gunpei Yokoi who couldn't find work with major Tokyo companies
- Initially tasked with servicing card-making machines, but little work meant he could experiment

**Yokoi's Innovation and Passion**:
- Enthusiastic hobbyist: piano, ballroom dancing, choir, model trains, car tinkering, monozukuri ("thing making")
- In first few months at Nintendo, he created a simple extendable arm using wood pieces and gripping tool

#### "Yokoi's Lateral Thinking: Withered Technology for Creative Play"

- Electronics not Yokoi’s strong point
- Yokoi handled more of the design and interface aspects
- Okada was Yokoi's codesigner on Game & Watch and Game Boy.

#### The Life and Legacy of Nintendo Pioneer Gunpei Yokoi

**Yokoi's Philosophy and Legacy:**
- **Philosophy**: Focuses on "vague knowledge of everything," encourages sharing ideas, and producing rather than specializing in specific skills.
- **Inspiration for Young Employees**: Encourages experimentation with technology and ideas, rather than just engineering.
- **Blurting Out Crazy Ideas**: Sets the tone for open discussion and sharing of novel uses of old technology.

**Impact on Nintendo**: Yokoi's philosophy led to the development of Nintendo Wii, which was criticized as not innovative but brought video games to a new audience due to its simple games and motion-based controls.

**Queen Elizabeth II's Engagement**: Queen Elizabeth II played Wii Bowling, showcasing the accessibility of the platform.

**Yokoi's Greatest Failure**: Departed from his design tenets with Virtual Boy, a gaming headset that relied on experimental technology and resulted in a heavy device that could not function as goggles.

#### Lateral Thinking and the Importance of Synergy in Science

**Yokoi's Inventions**
- Developed a device for displaying images on a screen that required users to assume an unnatural posture
- Despite its advanced technology, the device was not commercially successful

**Yokoi's Thinking**
- Believed in the importance of lateral thinking and generalists in addition to vertical thinking and specialists
- Concerned that hyperspecialists would overshadow generalists as companies grew and technology progressed
- Acknowledged the need for both "focused frogs" and "visionary birds" in various fields

**Dyson's Perspective**
- Compared "birds" (broad thinkers) to "frogs" (deep thinkers) in mathematics
- Advocated for collaboration between the two types of thinkers to explore the world effectively
- Warned about the dangers of science becoming overly specialized and narrow

**Ouderkirk's Story**
- Recounted a conversation with three company owners about a "breakthrough in glitter"
- Described his surprise at finding an application for multilayer optical film in creating highly reflective glitter
- Noted that he, as a physical chemist, typically expected breakthroughs to involve sophisticated technologies rather than seemingly mundane applications.

#### Multilayer Optical Film Revolutionizes Light Technology

**Multilayer Optical Film: The Impossible Possibility**

**Background:**
- Ouderkirk's idea: layer thin plastic surfaces for custom reflection and refraction of light
- Initial skepticism from optics specialists
- Natural examples inspire concept (iridescent butterfly, water bottle)

**Development:**
- Formation of small team to make it a reality
- Hundreds of polymer layers tailored for specific wavelengths
- Reflects light nearly perfectly in all directions
- Enhances energy efficiency in various applications (cell phones, laptops, LED bulbs, solar panels, fiber optics)
- Reduces power consumption for bright screens

**Applications:**
- Projector efficiency improvement
- Communication with trapped miners using pocket-sized projectors

**Benefits:**
- Relatively cheap and mass producible
- Lightweight and shimmering in appearance

**Challenges:**
- Initially thought to be unachievable by experts
- Misconceptions about the technology's capabilities

**Quotes from Ouderkirk:**
- "Everybody knows this, that knows anything about polymers… But nobody ever thought of making optical films out of this."
- "It’ s in front of you literally every day. But nobody ever thought of it."
- "The applications are beyond glitter."
- "Nobody had looked at a plastic water bottle that way before."

#### The Role and Characteristics of Polymath Inventors

**The Adjacent Stuff: The Secret to Successful Invention**

**Ouderkirk's Findings:**
- **Inventor Expertise**: Ouderkirk studied inventors at 3M and found two types: specialists and generalists.
    - Specialists: Focused on a single technology, deep knowledge but limited breadth.
        * Long-term focus on difficult technical problems
        * Anticipation of development obstacles
    - Generalists: Jacks-of-all-trades, broad knowledge but not necessarily deep expertise.
        * Bored quickly in one area
        * Integrated domains and applied technology across numerous areas
- **Depth vs. Breadth**: Neither depth nor breadth alone predicted a successful invention.
    - Specialists: Limited impact if they lacked significant depth or had too little breadth.
    - Generalists: Could not compete with specialists in terms of technical knowledge but made contributions through integrating domains and applying technology.

**Polymaths:**
- **New Type of Inventor**: Ouderkirk's team identified a third type of inventor, the polymaths.
    - Depth in a core area with numerous patents
    - Broad knowledge, worked across many technology classes
        * Applied expertise from one domain to another
    - Increased breadth over time as they learned about "the adjacent stuff" while losing a small amount of depth.

**Conclusion:**
- Specialists, generalists, and polymaths all made contributions at 3M but in different ways.
- The key to successful invention may lie in embracing both depth and breadth, as well as the ability to move between domains (the adjacent stuff).

#### The Decline of Specialists: A New Era for Polymaths in Technology

**Polymaths vs Specialists: Changing Roles in Innovation**

**The Success Factor at Carlton A Ward:**
- Polymaths (generalists) more likely to succeed than specialists
- Technical specialization not key ingredient for success at 3M

**Ouderkirk's Background:**
- Interested in chemistry since second grade
- Winding path from community college to PhD
- Worked outside of chemical background in laser lab at 3M
- Patents range from optics to metalworking to dentistry

**The Decline of Specialists:**
- Peaked around 1985, declined significantly since then
- Cause not definitively identified by Ouderkirk
- Hypothesis: Communication technology reduces need for narrow specialists

**Impact of Technology on Innovation:**
- More accessible information leads to fewer specialist jobs
- Increased opportunities for connectors and polymathic innovators.

**The Role of Polymaths (Generalists):**
- Important contributions in various technological domains
- Adaptable and knowledgeable across multiple fields.

#### The Advantage of Cross-Domain Innovation: T-Shaped People

**Specialization vs. Breadth**

**Specialization**:
- Keep going straight
- Obvious choice
- No statistically significant relationship between R&D spending and performance for bottom 10% of spenders
- **Advice received**: Stay in one technical lane, even if not enthusiastic about it

**Breadth (Generalists/Polymaths)**:
- Trickier to grow
- Requires opportunity
- Jayshree Seth's career path:
  - Switched focus away from PhD research for personal reasons
  - Branched out into new domains
  - More than 50 patents, helped create new adhesives and diapers
  - Described as a "T-shaped person" with breadth and depth
  - Used investigative journalism approach to innovation
  - Attacked problems by building narrative, mosaic building

**Impact of Lack of Opportunity**:
- Imagined not having access to network of peers would not work well for innovation.

#### "Creative Breakthroughs and the Role of Individual Breadth"

**Impact of Breadth on Innovation: The Case of Comic Books**

**Background:**
- Ouderkirk's experience in identifying important projects based on his broad knowledge
- Specialists excel in well-defined problems, but breadth becomes crucial with uncertainty (Melero & Palomeras research)

**Impact of Uncertainty on Creativity: Comic Books as a Case Study**
- Creative explosion in comic books after self-censorship ended in the 1970s
- Marvel Comics published Spider-Man story about drug abuse despite censorship opposition
- Resulted in relaxed standards and creative floodgates opening

**Research by Taylor and Greve:**
- Studied individual creators' careers and analyzed commercial value of comics produced
- Expected typical industrial production learning curve: more experience equals better work

**Findings:**
- Creators producing more comics in a given span of time did not necessarily make better or worse work on average (no impact on the average value)
- However, they found that high-breadth creators had a significant impact on variance – ability to create spectacular failures or successes beyond their norms.

#### The Power of Diverse Genre Experience in Creativity

**Study Findings on Creators' Performance:**
- Experience in industry did not significantly impact comic quality or innovation (contrary to intuition)
- Resource availability did not influence creators' performance or innovativeness
- High repetition workload negatively impacted performance
- Genre diversity among creators was a key factor for better average performance and higher likelihood of innovation:
  - Individuals with broad genre experience surpassed teams in innovation
  - Diverse experiences led to creative integration and superior results
- Early individual creators were less innovative than teams, but their innovativeness increased with broadened experience

**Comparison to Favorite Comics Creators:**
- Hayao Miyazaki: Known for Spirited Away but had a diverse portfolio ranging from various genres
- Neil Gaiman: Novelist, screenwriter, and comics author with an expansive range in fiction
- Jordan Peele: Writer and director of Get Out credited comedy writing for his skill in horror filmmaking.

**Implications:**
- Specialization can be costly in knowledge-based industries when seeking innovation.
- Teams of specialists work well in standardized environments, but individual creators with diverse experiences outperform them in innovative industries.

#### The Advantage of Specialized Teams and Serial Innovators

**Surgery Teams:**
- Specialized surgeons and teams make fewer mistakes and work faster through repetition of procedures
- Importance of experience: patients prefer doctors who have performed procedure many times before
- Efficiency in delegating tasks for smooth flights
  - NTSB found that majority of major flight accidents occurred on first day new crew worked together

**Innovation:**
- Familiar tools can hinder breakthrough innovations
- Serial Innovators:
  * High tolerance for ambiguity
  * System thinkers
  * Additional technical knowledge from peripheral domains
  * Repurpose available tools
  * Connect disparate pieces of information in new ways
  * Synthesize information from multiple sources
  * Broad range of interests
  * Read widely and communicate with experts outside their domain

**Darwin:**
- Modern Thomas Edison, serial innovator
- Professional outsider: not a university faculty member or professional scientist
- Networked into scientific community
- Focused on barnacles but grew tired of it
- Relied on correspondents for research and experiments
  - Had at least 231 scientific pen pals in various interest areas.

#### "Serial Innovators and Their Multidisciplinary Mindset"

**Darwin's Research Methodology:**
* Peppered scientists with questions
* Collected information haphazardly in chaotic notebooks
* Tore pages out and filed them by themes
* Corresponded with experts from various fields for own experiments
* Ideas appeared disorganized, but represented ongoing enterprises

**Characteristics of Serial Innovators:**
* Broad interests in multiple specialties
* Hobbies and avocations reflecting wide range of experiences
* Focus on boundaries and interfaces between systems
* Frustration with traditional schooling due to broadness of interests
* Valuable for facing uncertain environments and wicked problems

**Hiring Practices and Serial Innovators:**
* Narrow focus in current hiring practices can screen out potential innovators
* Mechanistic approach reduces numbers of high-potential candidates
* Broad experience essential for understanding complex situations.

### CHAPTER 10 Fooled by Expertise

**The Fate of Humanity: Overpopulation Debate Between Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon**

**Paul Ehrlich's Perspective:**
- Believed it was too late to prevent a doomsday apocalypse from overpopulation
- Warned of mass starvation deaths due to resource shortages in the 1970s
- Compared population growth curve to natural population explosions and crashes
- Forecasted disastrous scenarios, including nuclear war and human extinction
- Saw population controls as the only hope for survival, even suggesting extreme measures like abortion and sterilization

**Julian Simon's Counterargument:**
- Optimistic about innovation and technological advancements in agriculture
- Proposed a bet with Ehrlich that crop yields would increase and resources would not become scarce
- Believed more people meant more good ideas and technological breakthroughs
- Saw population growth as a solution rather than a problem.

**Key Points:**
- Debate between Paul Ehrlich (pessimist) and Julian Simon (optimist) on the impact of overpopulation
- Ehrlich's belief in doomsday apocalypse due to resource depletion and mass starvation
- The "green revolution" and innovation as potential solutions proposed by Julian Simon.

#### "Ehrlich's Misguided Predictions: The Population Bomb Debate"

**The Bet between Ehrlich and Simon**
- In 1980, Paul Ehrlich made a bet with economist Julian Simon over the future price of metals (e.g., tin, copper)
- The terms: if metal prices went up by 1990, Simon would pay Ehrlich $576.07; if they went down, Ehrlich would pay $1,000 to Simon

**The Outcome and Aftermath**
- By October 1990, Simon received a check for $576.07 from Ehrlich
- Ehrlich's prediction of population growth leading to food shortages and price increases proved inaccurate
- Technological advancements and decreasing child mortality/increased education led to population growth rate decline
- The United Nations projects human population near peak by end of century, with zero population growth or decline

**Ehrlich's Predictions vs. Reality**
- Ehrlich made incorrect predictions despite technological developments that alleviated food shortages
- Continued to receive prestigious awards and a large following for his views
- Simon became a standard-bearer against excessive regulations hindering innovation

**The Scientific Debate**
- Both men adamant about the primacy of facts and science
- Each missed the value of the other's ideas

**Additional Insights**
- Commodity prices not accurate proxy for population effects, as they were influenced by macroeconomic cycles
- Ehrlich would have won the bet 62% of the time based on historical metal price trends.

#### Expert Forecasting: Overconfidence and Unreliable Predictions

**Paul Ehrlich vs. Julian Simon: A Study on Predictions**

**Background:**
- Disagreements between Ehrlich (environmentalist) and Simon (technologist)
- Intellectual sparring partners with contrasting views
- Misunderstandings and dogmatism in arguments

**Impact of Regulations**:
- Improvements in air and water quality not solely due to technological initiative and markets
- Regulations pressed by Ehrlich and others played a significant role

**Paul Sabin's Perspective:**
- Intellectual partners should sharpen each other's arguments
- The opposite happened between Ehrlich and Simon

**Experts as Forecasters:**
- Philip Tetlock initiated study on expert predictions
- Collecting short-term and long-term forecasts from 284 experts
- Results showed that the average expert was a poor forecaster:
  - Inaccurate in both short-term and long-term predictions
  - Specialty, experience, degrees, or access to classified information made no difference.

**Danish Proverb:**
- "It is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future."

#### "Integrative Forecasting Outperforms Single-Approach Experts"

**Experts vs. Dilettantes: Forecasting Soviet Union's Future**

**Expert Behavior:**
- Experts were inflexible in their predictions

- Believes that narrow experts may have blinders on, so it's important to take a multidisciplinary approach.

#### Collaborative Forecasting: The Power of Collective Intelligence

**Superforecasters' Online Interactions:**
- Exercises in polite antagonism: disagreeing without being disagreeable
- Focus on aggregating perspectives, not agreement
- Teamwork and collaboration: sharing information, challenging each other

**Characteristics of Superforecasters:**
- Foxes with dragonfly eyes: synthesize multiple perspectives
- Quick to adapt and flip-flop when new information emerges

**Comparison to Politicians:**
- Differences in approach: politicians vs. superforecasters
- Politicians may not update forecasts based on new information

**Forecasting Errors:**
- Major banks' exchange rate predictions were often incorrect (from 2000 to 2010)
- In six out of ten years, the true exchange rate fell outside the entire range of bank forecasts.

#### Encouraging Active Open-Mindedness in Debate

**Active Open-Mindedness**:
- Psychologist Jonathan Baron's term for a hallmark of interactions on the best teams
- View own ideas as hypotheses in need of testing
- Aim to encourage teammates to help falsify one's own notions, not convince them of expertise

**Aversion to Contrary Ideas**:
- Not normal across humanity
- People naturally come up with "myside" ideas, rather than search for evidence to the contrary

**Experiment Findings**:
- Canadian and US study: 2/3 of participants refused to read counterarbitrary arguments
- More scientifically literate adults are more likely to become dogmatic about polarizing topics
- Voters misinterpreted statistics that disagreed with their political beliefs

**Science Curiosity**:
- Kahan found that science curiosity, not just knowledge, is important in remaining open-minded
- Measured through consumer marketing surveys and follow-up information consumption
- Highly curious individuals freely roam for information, listen carefully, and consume omnivorously.

#### The Power of Open-Mindedness in Scientific Discovery

**Active Open-Mindedness:**
* Best forecasters possess high active open-mindedness
* Curious and proactively seek out contrary ideas
* Depth insufficient without breadth (Jonathan Baron)
* Examples: Darwin, Henslow, Lyell's "Principles of Geology"
	+ Darwin: deeply curious, actively open-minded
	+ Henslow urged him to read controversial book
	+ Revelation for Darwin and shift in thinking
* Importance of hedgehogs vs foxes
	+ Hedgehogs produce vital knowledge (Einstein)
	+ See simple, deterministic rules within complexities
	+ Deterministic cause-and-effect relationships
	+ Examples: Einstein's later years, Bohr's perspective on universe.

**Active Open-Mindedness vs Hedgehogs:**
* Active open-mindedness: curiosity and proactive search for knowledge
* Hedgehogs: experts who see simple rules within complexities
* Both essential in science and life
* Balance needed between the two approaches
* Benefits of active open-mindedness: adaptability, flexibility, ability to consider all evidence.

#### The Power of Structural Thinking in Uncertainty: Lessons for Forecasters

**Wicked Learning Environment**
- Lack of automatic feedback makes learning difficult
- Experience alone does not improve performance
- Effective habits of mind can be developed
- Four years of forecasting tournaments showed:
  - One hour of basic training in foxy habits improved accuracy
  - Generating list of separate events with deep structural similarities helps
    - Forces forecaster to think like a statistician
    - Events are not uniquely novel, but degree of novelty varies

**Forecasting Techniques**
- Starting with details is dangerous
- Skillful forecasters consider unrelated events with structural commonalities
  - Depart from problem at hand to consider related examples
- Ferociously dissect prediction results for lessons
- Rigorous feedback at every opportunity

**Belief Updating**
- Good judges are good belief updaters
  - Update beliefs after successful or unsuccessful predictions
- Hedgehogs may become more convinced of wrong beliefs after losses
  - Put experience aside and embrace the logic of a loss: learning.

### CHAPTER 11 Learning to Drop Your Familiar Tools

**CHAPTER 11: Learing to Drop Your Familiar Tools**

**The Carter Racing Team's Dilemma:**
- Jake, a sandy blonde athlete, advocates for racing the car in the upcoming big race
- Six Harvard Business School classmates debate whether to participate or not
- **Argument in favor of racing**:
  * Carter Racing has placed in the top five in twelve out of twenty-four races
  * Oil company and Goodstone Tire sponsorships secured
  * Last race win resulted in a potential $2 million sponsorship from Goodstone
  * National TV exposure could lead to more opportunities
- **Argument against racing**:
  * Engine failures in seven races, causing damage each time
  * Uncertainty about the cause of recent engine issues
  * Loss of oil sponsorship and possible end of business if engine fails on national TV
  * Financial loss of approximately $80,000 if team withdraws
- Students vote: three for racing, four against. Debate ensues.

**Considerations in the Debate:**
- Jake believes team has a 50% chance of success and a bigger upside than potential losses
- Justin thinks team cannot afford not to race
- Alexander questions dissenters' readiness to change their stance
- Mei focuses on loss mitigation and doesn't want to risk another engine failure.

**Engine Mechanic's Perspective:**
- Pat, the engine mechanic, has a decade of race experience but lacks sophisticated engineering training.

#### Investigating Engine Failure: Temperature vs. Probability

**Engine Failure Analysis:**
* **Temperature issue suggested by Pat**: engine components expanding at different rates on cool days leading to head gasket failure
* **No correlation found between temperature and failures according to Robin's graph**
* **Dmitry's perspective**: optimal engine range, not too cold or hot; low probability of finishing and getting in top five if failures are random
* **Julia's view**: temperature idea is "nonsense," risk averse approach
* **Alexander's opinion**: "zero correlation" between temperature and engine failure
* **Dmitry's question**: is he the only one who sees a possible correlation?
* **Jake's criticism of Pat**: good mechanic but poor root cause analysis engineer
* **Missing information**: temperature data from races with no engine problems needed for proper analysis.
* **Consensus**: group agrees to race unless new information is available.

#### "Carter Racing's Decision: Race or Withdraw?"

**Carter Racing Case Study Discussion**

**Mei's Argument**:
- Carter Racing needs only a 26% chance of finishing in the top 5 to make racing a smart bet
- Dmitry's read of the data is biased, as there have been engine failures both below 65°F and above 65°F

**Jake's Perspective**:
- The expected value argument is a concrete way to base decisions
- Carter Racing has already implemented a new engine-prep procedure with no problems

**Dmitry's Recommendation**:
- Wants to set limits at the exact temperatures they have already experienced
- Knows his recommendation is arbitrary, but feels anything outside that range is unknown territory

**Group Decision**:
- With Mei's conversion, it's 4 to 3 in favor of racing
- The group moves forward with their decision

**Post-Discussion**:
- Some students question if the decision is only about money and potential risks

#### "Challenger Disaster: Group Decision-Making & Overlooking Crucial Data"

**Dmitry's Objection and Professor's Response:**
- Dmitry argues that engine failures aren't random, and data is ambiguous due to missing race temperatures where engines didn't fail
- Professor asks for a show of hands: 7 out of 10 students favor racing based on risk
- Professor grills Dmitry about statistical analysis and the importance of considering all available information

**NASA Challenger Case Study:**
- Data used in case study is based on NASA's tragic space shuttle Challenger launch in 1986
- O-rings failed due to cold temperatures, causing gas leakages and subsequent explosion
- Engine failures in racing and Challenger's launch both plotted on a graph: every race below 65 degrees had an engine failure (Challenger) or threat of one (racing)
- Professor uses logistic regression to show a 99.4% probability of engine failure at 40 degrees (temperature during Challenger launch)
- Students are surprised by the connection between racing and Challenger case study.

**Implications:**
- Engineers should consider all available data before making decisions, even if it isn't explicitly provided
- Temperature plays a crucial role in engine performance: cold temperatures can cause failure (O-ring hardening)
- Data analysis is essential for understanding risks and making informed decisions.

#### The Challenger Disaster: Misinterpretation of Data and Reliance on Quantitative Analysis

**Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster: Failure to Consider Relevant Data**

**Background:**
- Presidential commission investigated reasons for Challenger disaster
- Ongoing debate on quantitative analysis vs. incomplete data

**Implications of the Accident:**
- Misunderstanding of the importance of all relevant data
- NASA's reliance on quantitative analysis led to a failure to consider critical information

**Challenger Launch Decision:**
- Engineers discussed launching at cold temperatures: Thiokol engineers wanted postponement due to potential O-ring damage
- Discussion did not include quantitative correlation data between temperature and O-ring damage
- University of Chicago professor criticized participants for professional weaknesses
- NASA considered the incident definitive causal account of the tragedy (Vaughan, D.)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions
- Overreliance on quantitative analysis can overlook critical information

**Challenger Space Shuttle: O-Ring Failure Analysis:**
- Before ignition, O-rings in joints compress and expand at ignition
- Cold temperatures cause harder rubber, longer time for expansion, risk of unsealed joints
- Protective putty insulates O-rings from burning gas
- On 17 successful flights with no O-ring problems: putty worked perfectly (no data on failure)
- On 7 failed flights: burning gas reached O-rings through holes in protective putty
- Two different varieties of O-ring issues occurred on these 7 flights

#### "Challenger Disaster: Ambiguous Decision-Making in Wicked Problems"

**Challenger Space Shuttle Disaster: O-Ring Failure**

**Erosion**:
- Burning gas hit the O-rings during takeoff, eroding the rubber surface
- Not a life-or-death condition
- Had enough rubber to do its job
- Unrelated to temperature

**Blow-by**:
- If O-ring did not expand to seal joint at ignition, burning gas "blew by" and could potentially cause catastrophic failure
- Life-or-death condition
- Worsened in cold temperatures when O-ring rubber hardened
- 2 pre-Challenger flights had blow-by, but still returned safely

**Thiokol Engineers' Concerns**:
- Opposed launch due to only having 2 relevant data points (out of 24) on O-ring failure
- **Carter Racing study** indicated more information could have helped NASA avert disaster
- Other important quantitative data not accepted by NASA managers

**Challenger Decision**:
- Ambiguous, rife with uncertainty, outside previous experience
- Demanding more data became the problem itself

**Emergency Conference Call**:
- 34 engineers (all managers were also engineers) from three locations
- Thiokol engineer **Roger Boisjoly** presented photos of O-ring soot after each flight with blow-by
- Found more jet-black soot after 53-degree launch, indicating large amount of burning gas had blown past
- Unable to quantify concerns due to lack of data

#### Challenger Disaster: Lack of Quantitative Data and Decision-Making Crisis

**Impact of Quantitative Culture on Challenger Space Shuttle Launch Decision**

**Background:**
- Managers grilled engineers during emergency conference call regarding launch safety
- Previous launches had all been successful, but engineers advised against launch due to potential O-ring failure

**Consequences of a Quantitative Culture:**
- Engineers couldn't provide definitive data for their concerns
- NASA managers were frustrated by the lack of quantitative evidence
- Thiokol engineers suggested launching with limited temperature data
- Decision was based on "weaker engineering position" and subjective assessments

**Impact on NASA:**
- Agencies reliance on quantitative data caused frustration when it couldn't be provided
- Managers felt uneasy about making a decision without solid evidence
- Engineers used qualitative assessments, which were less effective in this situation

**Engineers' Concerns:**
- Based on photographs of joints with soot trapped in them
- Qualitative assessment that difference was significant
- Unable to defend their argument without quantitative data

**NASA's Response:**
- Mulloy argued he wouldn't feel confident making the decision without definitive evidence
- Lack of quantitative data led to perverse outcome in a critical situation.

#### The Psychology of Sticking with Familiar Tools in High-Risk Situations

**The Unfamiliar Challenge of Reason without Numbers**

**NASA Managers**:
- Failed to abandon familiar tools in unfamiliar situations

**Psychologist Karl Weick's Observations**:
- Smokejumpers and "hotshot" wilderness firefighters held onto their tools, even when ditching equipment would have allowed them to escape advancing fires

**The Mann Gulch Fire Tragedy**:
- Smokejumpers parachuted in expecting to contain the "ten o'clock fire" by 10am the next morning
- When the fire jumped across the gulch and chased them uphill, only two out of 13 men dropped their tools and survived
- The remaining 11 men and one woman were caught by the flames, still carrying their heavy packs

**Subsequent Wildland Firefighter Deaths**:
- In 1994 on Colorado's Storm King Mountain, 14 hotshots and smokejumpers lost the race with a Mann Gulch situation
- Despite knowing they should drop their tools, many firefighters continued to carry them

**Similar Phenomena**:
- Navy seamen ignoring orders to remove steel-toed shoes when abandoning a ship
- Fighter pilots refusing orders to eject from disabled planes
- Karl Wallenda, the high-wire performer, grabbing his balance pole rather than the wire when falling 120 feet to his death

**Conclusion**:
- The firefighters' irrational attachment to their tools led to tragic outcomes.

#### "The Perils of Sticking to Familiar Methods: NASA Challenger Disaster"

**Understanding Organizational Adaptation: Insights from a Firefighter's Perspective**

**The Concept of "Dropping One's Tools"**:
- Represents unlearning, adaptation, and flexibility
- Refers to the reluctance of people to abandon familiar methods
- Can lead to tragic outcomes when organizations regress to what they know best

**Firefighters as a Metaphor for Organizational Rigidity**:
- Firefighting tools define firefighter group membership
- Dropping one's tools creates an "existential crisis"
- Feels like losing control, as firefighters identify with their tools

**Can-Do vs. Make-Do Cultures**:
- **Can-do culture**: Belief that everything will be fine if procedures are followed
- **Make-do culture**: Necessity to improvise when outside usual bounds

**NASA's Challenger Tragedy**:
- NASA's "can-do" culture manifested as faith in established procedures
- Engineers disregarded qualitative arguments, considering them emotional
- Boisjoly's argument about cold weather not conforming to usual standards was deemed inadmissible
- Conformity within the rocket-booster group led to silence despite agreement with Boisjoly

#### The Wicked Nature of Decision-Making in the Challenger Disaster

**Impact of Overreliance on Familiar Tools**

**Difficulty in Dropping Familiar Tools:**
- Experienced professionals face challenges when required to abandon overlearned behavior
- Automatic responses developed through repeated use
- Can lead to flawed decision making, particularly during uncertain situations

**Decision Making vs. Sensemaking:**
- Crew leadership: Gleason preferred sensemaking over decision making
  - More dynamic and open to revision
  - Listens to questions and changes plan accordingly
- NASA's procedure: focused on defending decisions instead of using all available information

**Impact of Past Procedures:**
- NASA managers relied heavily on quantitative data, which was not the best tool for the job in this case
- Thiokol engineers didn't feel comfortable speaking up without definitive data
- Merging with tools: NASA followed a process it had always used, even when it wasn't effective.

**Impact of Communication:**
- Miscommunication between teams led to misunderstandings and faulty decision making
  - Importance of clear communication during uncertainty
- Lack of data did not equate to an absence of opinion or reasoning (Feynman's perspective)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Understanding when to drop familiar tools is crucial for effective decision making in uncertain situations
- Embrace sensemaking as a more dynamic and open approach to problem solving
- Clear communication that encourages questioning and revision can lead to better outcomes.

#### "Navigating Uncertainty in High-Stress Environments: A Rescue Team's Story"

**Wildland Firefighters and Space Shuttle Engineers:**
- Cannot train for challenging moments through trial and error
- Reliable and flexible teams are like a jazz group:
    - Overlearn fundamentals (scales, chords) as tools for sensemaking in dynamic environments
    - Ability to drop, reimagine, or repurpose tools for unfamiliar challenges

**Pararescue Jumpers (PJs):**
- Team at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan:
    - Goes to work only when someone gets "really unlucky"
    - Perform harrowing rescue missions, like nighttime parachuting into enemy territory to save downed pilots
- No typical day:
    - Rescued soldiers injured in firefights or fallen into wells
    - Stayed on 24/7 alert, waiting for a "9-line" (form with 9 lines providing emergency information)

**Incident Description:**
- Category alpha, traumatic injuries: Roadside bomb explosion in an Army convoy of armored vehicles
- Sparse intel: Unclear number and severity of injured soldiers, potential for search and rescue trap
- PJs prepared to bring heavy equipment (Jaws of Life, diamond-tipped saw) due to armored vehicle construction
- Challenges: Altitude limiting helicopter lift, fuel limitations, limited space in helicopters for patients
- Lesmes' priority: Save enough room for potential patients to avoid multiple visits to the explosion site.

#### "Field Leader's Dilemma: Managing Uncertainty in a Mass-Casualty Scenario"

**Rescue Operation Challenges:**
- Severely wounded soldiers require extra time for treatment
- More time on site increases risk of enemy attention
- Limited information and intelligence

**Decision Making Process:**
- Team members suggested various solutions: moving equipment, leaving PJs behind, evacuating seriously injured patients first
- Challenges with convoy mobility in rugged terrain
- Lack of definitive intel on number of casualties

**Lesmes' Assessment:**
- Traditional decision trees don't apply to the situation
- No clear advantage or solution for a worst-case scenario
- Needed more information and resources to be successful

**Lesmes' Idea:**
- Put himself at the frontlines to preserve space for potential patients
- Had never used this approach in mass-casualty situations before
- Role is typically to keep a broad view of the situation while PJs work on patients or secure site.

#### Leadership Dilemma: Balancing Life-Saving Decisions and Cohesion

**Soldiers' Experiences during Rescue Mission:**
* Soldiers witnessed teammates in need of medical aid after an explosion
* Desperate to help but had to be moved due to limited resources
* Senior enlisted member, Lesmes, managed ground leadership and coordinated helicopter pickups
* Lesmes proposed staying at base to save room for equipment and patients
* Objections raised by soldiers: objection to commander's absence, fear, and adherence to standard operating procedure (SOP)
* Lesmes remained stoic but was deeply affected, acknowledging the importance of team cohesion
* Rescue mission successful with all injured soldiers surviving
* Senior enlisted member acknowledged it as the right call later on.

**Lesmes' Leadership and Decision Making:**
* Proposed staying at base due to limited resources and potential need for multiple trips
* Hesitation from team members due to emotional attachment, philosophical objections, and questioning of judgment
* Stoic demeanor but deeply affected by situation
* Ultimately decided to stay and coordinate rescue efforts from the operations center.

#### Mixed Messages: A Strategy for Balancing Consistency and Flexibility in Organizational Culture

**Interview with Bagram PJ Lesmes:**
- Struggles with decision not to evacuate during Challenger disaster: "Sometimes, I still struggle with that decision"
- Discusses possibility of regret or bad consequences if they had canceled launch: "Maybe it was luck. None of the options at the time looked very optimal."
- Agrees that experienced professionals may regress to what they know best under pressure: "Y eah, mmm-hmm... Everything is built on that."
- Discusses importance of tool use vs dropping them: "But everything is built on that."

**Captain Lesmes's Decision:**
- Dropped sacred tool (team togetherness) in challenging situation
- Initially met with resistance from some team members, but eventually acknowledged as the right call by several
- Emotional impact: "It went back over it and it brought tears to my eyes."

**NASA's Handling of Challenger Disaster:**
- Managers made mistakes of conformity, stuck to usual tools in face of unusual challenge
- Engineers who pushed for abort could have been seen as "Chicken Littles"
- Importance of balance between tool proficiency and readiness to drop them: "But everything is built on that."

**Congruence and Organizational Theory:**
- Congruence refers to consistency among an organization's components (values, goals, etc.)
- Effective cultures promote self-reinforcing consistency, but study found no correlation with organizational success in higher education institutions.

#### Paradoxical Leadership: The Benefits of Incongruence

**Effective Leaders and Organizations:**
- Effective leaders and organizations exhibit range
- Can be demanding and nurturing, orderly and entrepreneurial, hierarchical and individualistic all at once
- Ambiguity not harmful in decision making: broadens toolbox

**Philip Tetlock and Barbara Mellers' Research:**
- Tolerance of ambiguity leads to best forecasts
- Flexibility and learning

**Experiment on Corporate Human Resources Managers:**
- Presented with standard evaluation process for job applicants
- Conformed to standard procedure even when it failed, failed to learn
- Incongruence introduced: fake Harvard Business Review research promoting independence and dissent
	+ Openness to learning and improved accuracy

**Cure for Lack of Learning:**
- Fake Harvard Business Review research promoting cohesion, loyalty, and common ground
	+ HR managers hewed closer to traditional process when it had value, deviated readily when it didn't.

**Business School Teachings:**
- Congruence model: align all work elements into a culture of mutually reinforcing influences (cohesion or individualism)

#### Balancing Rigid Processes and Informal Cultures for Flexible Decision Making

**Expanding Organizational Range through Incongruence:**
* Balancing standard practice with opposing forces ensures effective problem-solving cultures (Tetlock)
* Identify dominant culture to diversify it: NASA's 'can do' culture became too rigid for conformity
* Extreme process accountability combined with collectivist social norms (NASA before Challenger)
* Capt. Lesmes harnessed cross-pressure for flexible thought and accurate forecasting teams
* Balancing risks of mindless conformity and reckless deviation

**NASA's Culture Before Challenger:**
* Manifested as extreme process accountability & collectivist social norms (conformity to standard procedures)
* Dissent valued at flight readiness reviews, but not during critical moments
* Engineers sought private caucuses for conformity instead of data
* Lack of data led to the boss' opinion being preferred

**Balancing Incongruence:**
* Kranz: valorized process but sought opinions at every level (Apollo 11)
* Von Braun: balanced rigid process with informal, individualistic culture (constant dissent & cross-boundary communication)
* Good Judgment Project incentivized collective culture for accurate forecasting teams.

#### NASA's Culture of Process Accountability: Lessons from the Challenger and Columbia Disasters

**Monday Notes at Marshall Space Flight Center**

**Origins**:
- Engineers submitted weekly one-page notes on salient issues
- Von Braun handwrote comments and circulated the compiled notes
- Everyone saw what other divisions were working on and raised potential problems

**Evolution**:
- **1974**: William Lucas took over, transformed Monday Notes into upward communication system
- **1974**: Notes became standardized forms for reporting issues
- Quality declined due to lack of feedback and circulation

**Impact on NASA Culture**:
- Emphasis on hierarchy, procedure, and following rules
- Lack of cross-pressures hindered learning and improvement

**Lessons Learned**:
- Individuals within NASA learned vital cultural lessons despite organizational issues
- These lessons were put to use when needed

**Challenger and Columbia Disasters**:
- Process culture persisted, leading to disasters with similar management and cultural aspects
- Engineers unable to raise concerns due to requirements for data and adherence to hierarchy and procedure
- NASA identified as not functioning as a "learning organization" during this time.

#### Space Probe Launch Confronts Technical Challenges and High Stakes

**Gravity Probe B Project (GPB)**

**Background:**
- NASA project since 1958, $750 million budget
- Longest running project in NASA's history
- Delayed numerous times for technical issues and funding
- Test of Einstein's general theory of relativity

**Challenges:**
- Precisely spherical gyroscopes: quartz rotors, ping-pong ball size
  - Cooled to −450°F with liquid helium
  - Delicate thrusters for maneuvering
- High pressure to launch after Columbia disaster
- Engineers found power supply interference issue
  - Critical scientific instrument affected
  - Box only needed to work during beginning of mission
- Risk of removing parts vs. leaving it alone
- Stanford University prime contractor
- Launch delayed would cost $10–$20 million
- Earthquake risk at Vandenberg Air Force Base

**Key Decision:**
- GPB team leader, NASA chief engineer, and head scientist pushed for launch
- Stanford team confident they could succeed despite issues.

#### "Avoiding a Launch Disaster Through Informal Communication"

**Geveden's Dilemma at NASA:**

**Background:**
- Geveden joined NASA in 1990, experienced a "conformance culture" (Morton Thiokol's influence)
- Intuition that something was wrong with the current culture
- Wanted balance between formal process and informal individualism

**Events leading to Decision:**
- Attended team building class where consensus was prioritized
- Recalled Challenger disaster and its aftermath
- Felt NASA's culture lacked healthy tension in decision making
- Respected Stanford's electronics manager for his concerns about the power supply box
- Formally met with head engineer and scientist advocating to leave box in place
- Conducted informal meetings with team members uncovering:
  - Manager from Lockheed Martin's concern about fragile technology
  - Known design problems that weren't clear in schematics (unknown unknowns)
  - Twenty separate issues discovered after box was pulled
- Earthquake near launch site damaged launch vehicle but probe remained intact.

**Geveden's Decision:**
- Against recommendations, decided to scrub the launch and pull the power supply box
- Discovered multiple design problems that hadn't been identified earlier.

#### Balancing Hierarchy and Individualism for Organizational Success

**Gravity Probe B (GP-B) Project**
- First direct test of Einstein's theory that Earth drags space-time around with it as it spins (April 2004)
- Supported by components that improved digital cameras, satellites, and GPS applications

**NASA Leadership Changes**
- New NASA administrator appointed in 2014
- Encouraged individualism and debate for organizational health
- Geveden became associate administrator, highest position not politically appointed

**Geveden's Leadership Style**
- Emphasized disagreement and compliance after decisions are made
- Distinction between chain of command and communication
- Supported cross-pressure in the organization
- Encouraged information flow from all levels
- Compared to "circular management" where information can move in many directions

**Hierarchy vs. Individualism in Teams**
- Study found teams strongly valuing hierarchical culture had more summits but higher deaths
- Solo climbers not affected by this trend
- Both hierarchy and individualism necessary for team success and survival

#### The Limits of Specialization in Medicine and Science

**Balancing Act in Cultivating Aspects of a Culture**
- Difficulty in balancing aspects that seem to contradict each other
- No rules for qualitative hunches of space shuttle engineers or pararescue jumpers
- Incongruence helps people discover useful cues and drop traditional tools when necessary

**Experimental Research and Volcano Experts**
- Volcano experts insist volcanic eruptions are the primary cause of mass extinctions
- Attributed many extinctions to volcanoes with little evidence
- Devotion to a particular tool can lead to disastrous myopia

**Interventional Cardiology and Stents**
- Interventional cardiologists specialize in treating chest pain with stents
- Logic of placing stents to open narrowed arteries seems compelling
- Randomized clinical trials show no benefit from stents for patients with stable chest pain
- Interventional cardiologists struggle to accept that stenting does not work

**Orthopedic Surgery and Meniscus Repair**
- Common orthopedic surgery involves shaving torn menisci back to original shape
- Sham surgery (faking the procedure) works just as well as real surgery for knee pain with torn meniscus
- Most people with torn meniscus have no symptoms, and tear may not be related to pain

**Importance of Broad Perspective**
- Seeing individual parts in isolation is insufficient to address humanity's greatest challenges
- Need for biodiversity in an increasingly specialized world
- Individuals who possess a broad range of skills and knowledge are valuable assets

- **Graphene**: flexible, transparent conductor made of carbon atoms
- Spiders have spun stronger silk using graphene
- Previously considered theoretical arrangement of carbon atoms
- Initial work submitted to prestigious journal met with skepticism
- Geim and Novoselov: "deliberate amateurs" who explore different fields
	+ Geim's research style: graze shallow, deviate from standard practice
	+ Advantages: motivation, questioning things others don't ask
	+ Friday evenings for exploration
- **Novoselov**: PhD student of Geim, joined team after being deemed "wasting his life" in another lab
	+ Found equipment similar to previous lab but with more opportunities to explore different areas
	+ Youngest physics Nobel laureate in forty years at age thirty-six
- **Max Delbrück**: studied intersection of physics and biology, emphasized "limited sloppiness"
	+ Advice: be careful not to be too meticulous and limit exploration.

**Research Environment and Mindset**
- Geim's team: embraces mental meandering as a competitive advantage
- Protection from the cult of the head start increasingly rare.

#### Despecializing Education for Future Scientists: The R3 Initiative

**The Crisis in Scientific Research: A Call for Balance**
* Arturo Casadevall's perspective on scientific research crisis
* Two types of scientists: those who see the glass as half empty and those who see it as full
* Gravitational waves detection as an achievement for humanity
* Casadevall's background in microbiology and immunology, with notable contributions
* Concerns about scientific progress and retractions in literature
* The need to reverse the trend towards hyperspecialization

**Casadevall at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health**
* Lecture to colleagues on crisis in scientific research
* Warnings of accelerated retraction rate, lack of critical thinking skills
* Belief that young scientists rush to specialize prematurely
* Consequences: unable to produce good work and spot fraudulent work by others
* Desire to create a prototype for graduate science education

**The R3 Initiative: A Solution**
* Interdisciplinary classes offered as part of training program
* Includes philosophy, history, logic, ethics, statistics, communication, and leadership
* Goal: counteract the prevailing trend towards hyperspecialization
* Emphasis on critical thinking skills for future specialists.

#### "Critique of Modern Education for Scientists and Doctors"

**Course on Critical Thinking in Research:**
- "How Do We Know What Is True?" examines types of evidence through history and disciplines (history, science)
- Students act as detectives in "Anatomy of Scientific Error" to identify misconduct or poor methods
- Importance of critical thinking skills for scientists and researchers

**Challenges in Implementing Critical Thinking Education:**
- Opposition from professionals who argue against adding more training time due to already packed curricula (medicine, science)
- Emphasis on specialized knowledge instead of foundational reasoning skills (Casadevall's vision)
- Misconceptions about diagnostic tests in medicine:
  - False positive rate and its impact on overall probability of having the disease
  - Only a quarter of physicians and medical students from Harvard and Boston University got it right.

**Implications for Education:**
- Current education system may hinder critical thinking skills development (Casadevall's comparison to medieval guilds)
- Need for background knowledge and tools for thinking in medicine, science, and other fields.

#### Specialization vs. Interdisciplinary Research in Biomedicine

**Impact of Specialization on Research and Industries:**

**Microorganism Conferences**:
- Growth industry for conferences that invite only scientists working on a single specific microorganism
- Complete understanding of body's response to paper cut hindered due to focus on isolated pieces of immune system by specialists in hematology and immunology

**Immune Response as an Integrated System**:
- Scientists focus on one cell type for career advancement and grant funding
- Lack of pressure to integrate research findings from different disciplines
- Parallel trenches maintain researchers in isolation, rare to see connections between adjacent fields

**Financial Crisis Example**:
- Regulators specialized in specific areas of insurance, banking, securities, and consumers
- Overlooked systemic issues that led to 2008 global financial crisis

**Research Funding and Discoveries**:
- Biomedical research funding rose exponentially over 35 years while discoveries slowed down
- Life expectancy declined in countries with biomedical cutting edge, like UK and US
- Flu continues to kill hundreds of thousands annually despite outdated vaccines from the 1940s

**Interface between Specialties and Creators**:
- Interdisciplinary grant proposals go to highly specialized reviewers
- Great progress made at the interface between disciplines, but who defends the interface?

#### "The Power of Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration in Creativity"

**Networks and Creative Triumph**

**Universal Setup for Successful Teams**:
- Northwestern and Stanford researchers found a "universal" setup for creative triumph
- Thriving research groups had **porous boundaries** between teams
- Individuals moved easily among teams, crossing organizational and disciplinary boundaries
- Successful teams had **open collaborations** with new partners

**Unsuccessful Teams**:
- Unsuccessful teams were characterized by **isolated clusters** of collaborators
- Repeat collaborations led to stagnation and lack of creativity

**Importance of Boundary Crossing**:
- New collaborations allow for the import/export of ideas across disciplines
- Successful teams had members from diverse institutions and countries
- Migrants bring "arbitrage" opportunities, combining new knowledge with old problems

**Atypical Knowledge Combinations**:
- **Atypical knowledge combinations** are a strategy for creative success
- "Hit" papers featured a mix of conventional and unusual knowledge combinations
- Novel research papers cited unfamiliar journals and disciplines

#### "Bridging Knowledge: The Power and Challenges of Interdisciplinary Research"

**Impact of Research Papers Over Time**
- Group tracked impact of research papers over time
- New knowledge combinations less likely to be funded, published in prestigious journals, or cited initially
- After three years: new knowledge combos surpassed conventional papers and began accumulating more citations
- Fifteen years after publication: studies with multiple new knowledge combinations were more likely to be top 1% most-cited papers

**Casadevall's Advice on Building Knowledge**
- Encourages reading outside of field everyday
- Believes it expands one's world and increases chances of making connections

**Casadevall's Project Inspiration**
- Inspired by news article about robot finding radiation-eating mold in Chernobyl
- Made remarkable find: mold nourishing itself with radiation, not radioactive substances

**Casadevall's Experiences Outside the Lab**
- Family fled Cuba and arrived in Queens when he was eleven
- Worked at McDonald's from sixteen to twenty, learned valuable skills like handling pressure
- Brother taken hostage during holdup, now a successful trial lawyer
- Father wanted practical backup, so has community college degree in pest control operations

#### Shattering Specialization: The Importance of Range in Innovation

**Casadevall's Perspective on Basic Science and Specialization:**
- Casadevall is a renowned scientist in his field
- Has no trouble getting research grants
- Helps determine who receives grants
- Believes specialization can hinder progress towards solving humanity's greatest challenges
- Shares Polgar's belief that education should focus on broad knowledge and multiple disciplines

**Innovation History and HIV/AIDS:**
- When Casadevall was in medical school, retroviruses were seen as a curiosity
- HIV emerged in 1981, found to be a retrovirus in 1984, first therapy by 1987
- Society's previous investments in studying retroviruses led to the discovery of treatments for HIV
- Casadevall argues that focusing all research funding on one disease may not lead to its solution
- Innovation ecosystem should preserve range and inefficiency

**Funding Policy and Specialization:**
- In 2006, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison focused on commercial technology applications in research proposals
- Whisked away titles that did not directly relate to new commercial technologies
- Casadevall's perspective challenges the notion of focusing only on specializations with clear commercial potential.

#### The Paradox of Efficiency and Creativity: A Tug-of-War Between Focus and Exploration

**Hutchison's Classification of Disciplines:**
- Biology
- Geology
- Economics
- Archaeology

**Distracting from Technological Innovation:**
- Hutchison believed these disciplines distracted from technological innovation

**Successful Innovation Culture:**
- Vannevar Bush's report "Science, the Endless Frontier" (1945)
- Funded by President Roosevelt
- Led to NSF funding for scientific discovery
- Free play of intellects essential for exploration and discovery

**Limitations of Specialization:**
- "Free play" of intellects may be inefficient
- Focus on applications can limit creativity and synthesis
- Importance of unpredictable, unforeseen findings

**Impact of Breakthroughs:**
- Yoshinori Ohsumi's Nobel lecture (2016)
- Scientists required to demonstrate tangible applications
- Past breakthroughs not possible under modern focus on applications

**Importance of Inefficiency:**
- "Free play" and communication essential for creativity
- Bill Gore's approach at Gore-Tex: dabble time, crisis management
- Cultivating inefficiency for innovative ideas.

### CONCLUSION Expanding Your Range

**Conclusion**
- Reactions to the idea that athletes don't need early specialization: disbelief or request for advice
- Search for one sentence of advice on breadth and experimentation ended up being a book
- Stories of innovation and self-discovery often have "Tiger Path" narratives, minimizing role of detours and experimentation
- Experimentation has advantages but requires more than lip service to failure
- Breakthroughs are high variance, with many duds before mega successes
- Examples: Thomas Edison, Rachel Whiteread, Howard Scott Warshaw
- Business writer Michael Simmons' analogy: "Baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four."
- In wider world, every once in a while, one can "score 1,000 runs"
- Breakthrough creation is hard and inconsistent, not just luck
- Breadth, diverse experience, and interdisciplinary exploration are important, even in domains like sports and music where early specialization is common
- Comparing yourself to yourself from yesterday is more productive than comparing to others or feeling behind
- Approach personal growth like Michelangelo experimenting with a block of marble, willing to learn and adjust as you go.
- Diverse group of specialists cannot fully replace contributions of broad individuals
- Even if moving on from an area, the experience is not wasted
- Specialization is not inherently wrong, but mental meandering and personal experimentation are sources of power.
