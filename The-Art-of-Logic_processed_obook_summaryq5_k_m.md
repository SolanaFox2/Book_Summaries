### 1 Why logic

**Why Logic? The Power of Understanding the World**

**Simplifying Complexity**
- Two ways to simplify: forgetting details (abstraction) or becoming cleverer
- Importance of logic in understanding

**Accessing Truth**
- All areas of research aim for truth about the world
- Various methods to determine truth depending on subject matter
- Scientific method: theory, evidence, testing
- Mathematical truth accessed through logic

**Logic vs. Emotions in Accessing Truth**
- Logic and emotions intertwined but not synonymous
- Misuse of "logically" or "mathematically" can devalue the words

**Importance of Logic**
- Irrefutable foundation for understanding
- Essential in various fields, including mathematics and science
- Helps clarify complex concepts.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages of Logical Thinking

**Reasons for Clear Framework of Truth**
- Agree on things: avoid misunderstandings and disagreements (1)
  * Radical concept in a world full of oppositions (2)
  * Addressing misunderstandings to use power effectively (3)
  * Clear framework = clear rules for consensus (4)
- Example from Oxford–Cambridge boat race:
  * Imaginary line down the middle of the river (5)
  * Priority on each side, boats veer into opposing boat (6)
  * Clear understanding through expert commentary (7)
- Medical diagnosis and logic comparison (8):
  * Clear checklists for unambiguous diagnoses (9)
  * Consistent application by professionals (10)
  * Robustness of logic in mathematics (11)
  * Progress despite philosophical bafflement (12)
- Advantages of using logic:
  * Clear rules for unambiguous conclusions (13)
  * Consistent application by different people (14)
- Disadvantages of the logical world (15):
  * Inability to win arguments through yelling (16)

#### Unveiling the True Nature of Mathematics

**Disadvantages of Logical World vs Concrete World**
- Some people dislike logical world due to:
  - Inability to outmuscle or outresource others
  - Lack of physical presence and connection to reality
- Logical world can feel abstract and ungrounded
- Floating in abstract world is a pleasant sensation once accustomed

**Advantages of Logical World**
- Enables access to powerful techniques for disentangling arguments about society
- Allows travel further in real world, like flying through sky
- Whole point of mathematics

**Misconceptions About Mathematics**
- Often presented as set of rules and right answers (numbers) at school
- Proofs can be constructed using peculiar facts to prove unrelated results
- Tests and exams under arbitrary time pressure

**Real Maths vs School Maths**
- Real math is a world to explore, discover, and understand: the logical world
- Some people realize school math was just hoops to jump through; others hold onto love of math despite school experiences
- Inoculated against school math by mothers or excellent teachers who show math is more than numbers

**What Mathematics Really Is**
- Not the study of numbers, but a logical argument for mathematical truth
- Established through constructing logical arguments, not experiments, evidence, or replicability.

#### Logic as the Study of Order and Structure in Mathematics and Discourse

**Mathematics as the Study of Logical Things:**
- Mathematics is the study of how logical things work
- Focuses on understanding rules and applying logic to solve problems
- Determination of what we can study is linked with the method we use (logic)

**Rules in Mathematics:**
- Rules determine the unambiguous way to decide outcomes
- Clear cut sports have less ambiguity than complex ones
- Even clear-cut sports have rules regarding eligibility, drug use etc.
- Logic can be baffling without proper understanding of underlying principles
- Advanced study requires deep comprehension of logical rules and subtleties

**Logic in Arguments:**
- Clear definition of rules essential before engaging in an argument
- Importance of logic for effective communication
- Misunderstanding or misuse of logic leads to flawed arguments
- Experts' consensus doesn't equate to conspiracy theories.

**Understanding Logical Principles:**
- Effort is required for deep understanding of logical principles
- Clarification of rules and their application improves productivity in arguments.

#### Understanding the Differences Between Scientific, Mathematical, and Logical Arguments

**Understanding Science and Mathematics: Clarifying "Theory" and Agreeing on Truth**

**Background:**
- Difficulty of understanding science and mathematics rules for non-experts
- Misconceptions about the meaning of "theory" in these fields

**Science vs Math:**
- **Science**: proposed explanation, rigorously tested, statistically likely to be correct
- **Math**: set of results proven true according to logic, no probability involved

**Mathematics:**
- Clear framework: logical proofs agreed upon by mathematicians
- History of mathematical truths still taught and considered true
- Less uncertainty compared to real life

**Arguments in Real Life vs Mathematical Proofs:**
- Real life has more nuance and uncertainty than mathematics
- Disagreements are unavoidable due to genuine uncertainty about the world
- Some disagreements can be avoided through logical arguments

**Clarifying Arguments:**
- Longer and more complex than typical real-life arguments
- Lack of time for building up a complex argument in normal conversations is an issue.

#### Abstract Thinking and Logical Reasoning in Mathematics

**Importance of Longer Arguments**
- Humans have short attention spans, making it crucial to convey complex ideas succinctly
- Long arguments in mathematics can span hundreds of pages and years of planning
- Daily life problems require more than one or two sentence arguments
- Importance of building up and following complex logical arguments

**The Abstract World**
- Real objects don't behave according to logic
- Mathematics involves forgetting details to focus on logical processes
- One plus one: abstract concept of "thing" (not limited to cookies)
- Logic is a process of constructing arguments through careful deduction
- Normal life isn't entirely logical, so we impose conditions for logical study
- Forgetting pesky details takes us from real world to abstract world of ideas.

#### Advantages of Abstract Thinking: Unifying and Efficient Understanding

**Advantages of Abstract World**

**Logical Behavior**:
- Everything behaves logically
- Adding 1 + 1 always results in 2 (under the same conditions)

**Efficiency through Sameness**:
- Many different situations become "the same" when details are forgotten
- Allows for studying parts they have in common, more efficiently

**Finding Relationships between Situations**:
- Helps understand situations from different points of view
- A unifying act to find similarities between things
- Discarding outer layers reveals deep structures holding things together

**Accessibility of Ideas**:
- Everything exists as soon as you think of it
- No need to purchase or acquire physical resources for exploration

#### Understanding Analogies: Essence of Mathematical Thinking

**Thinking Logically: The Abstract World**

**Abstract Thinking:**
- Step towards logical thinking
- Imagining implications without experimentation
- Thought experiments

**Accessing the Abstract World:**
1. Identify important features of a situation
2. Strip away irrelevant details
3. Focus on inherent ideas
4. Make connections with other situations
5. Separate essential from coincidental

**Analogies in Thinking:**
- Essence of mathematical thinking
- Comparing apparently unrelated situations
- Clarifying complex concepts

**Affirmative Action and Competitive Edge:**
- Debate over fairness of help for disadvantaged people
- Some feel they're losing competitive edge
- Insight into thorny aspect of affirmative action

**Examples:**
1. London Underground system improvements: green markings on platforms for safer boarding
2. Commuters' reactions: preserving their "competitive edge"
3. Analogy between this situation and affirmative action discussions.

#### Understanding Ambiguity and Disagreement in Real-World Logic

**Logical Explanations vs. Sequences of Events/Personal Decisions**
- Logical explanations come from **deep and unchanging meanings of things**, not sequences of events or personal decisions/tastes
- Inherentness means understanding without relying on context

**Normal Use of Language vs. Logical Explanations**
- Normal language relies on context due to varying meanings of words
- Logical explanations need to be **independent of personal experiences**

**Understanding What is Inherent in a Situation**
- Involves understanding **why things are happening** in a fundamental sense
- Similar to asking "why?" repeatedly
- Requires deep understanding of what things mean

**Logic and Life**
- Nothing in the world behaves according to logic
- Mathematical arguments are unambiguous, but cannot draw completely unambiguous conclusions about the real world
- Disagreements can come from different uses of logic or ambiguous building blocks (concepts)
- Understanding mathematical logic helps identify sources of disagreement

#### "Understanding Logic as Illumination: Precision vs Pedantry"

**Logic as Illumination: Understanding Disagreements and Precision vs Pedantry**

**Logic's Role in Building Arguments**:
- Logic helps us understand disagreements by identifying the root of the issue
- In this book, we will examine:
  - What logic is as a discipline for building arguments
  - Its limitations
  - The importance of taking emotions seriously

**Pedantry vs Precision**:
- **Pedantry**: Precision that goes beyond what is necessary to shed light on a situation
- **Precision**: Clarity and understanding that helps illuminate a situation
- Distinction between pedantry and precision:
  - Pedantry may be perceived as excessive or unimportant by those with less tolerance for ambiguity
  - Context plays a role in determining the difference

**Ambiguities of Language**:
- Children often struggle with figurative language due to lack of context and understanding of subtle shades of nuance
- As adults, we develop the ability to become more relaxed about these ambiguities

**Example: Measuring Precision**:
- Weighing sugar for a cake vs. weighing sugar for macarons
- Importance of precision in different situations (e.g., anesthetic dosage)

**Logic and Illumination**:
- Logic helps illuminate situations, much like shining a light
- As we become more abstract, the "light" is raised off the ground, providing broader context but less detail
- The goal is always to achieve some level of illumination, which may require more time and effort than soundbites allow

**Impact vs. Truth**:
- In today's world, impact is often valued over truth
- However, it is possible to communicate truthfully with impact if we put in the necessary effort

### 2 What logic is

**Logical Implication:**
- Building block of logical arguments
- Demonstrates truth through logic instead of evidence
- Analogy: Logic (mathematics) to evidence (science)
- Reveals additional true statements, not new truths

**Understanding Logical Implication:**
1. Basis for logical arguments
2. Moves from one true statement to another
3. Not limited by cause and effect or probability
4. Inherent in statements, unchanging
5. Difference between logical implication and other uses of "if":
   - Personal taste: "If I eat chocolate then I am happy"
   - Threats, bribes, promises: "If you do X then Y will occur"
   - Agreements: "If condition A is met, then action B will be taken"
   - Causation: "If cause is present, then effect will follow"
   - Personal opinions: "If you loved me, you wouldn't say that." (means "I don't agree with your statement")
6. Misconceptions about logical implication:
   - Use of "imply" as synonym for insinuate
7. Exploring examples in this chapter to distinguish between truly logical implications and other uses of "if".

#### Logical Implications vs. Real-World "If...Then..."

**The Difference Between Normal Life and Logical Language**

**Normal Life Examples**:
- "If ... then ..." can mean different things in normal language compared to logical language
- Primary aim of normal language is **communication**, while the primary aim of logical language is to **eliminate ambiguity**
- Normal language relies on **context, body language, intonation, human understanding** to convey meaning
- Logical language lacks these benefits and is more rigid in interpretation

**Logical Implications**:
- "If ... then ..." can be a logical implication if it follows from inherent definitions (e.g., "if you have white privilege, then you have privilege")
- Statements about privilege can be contentious depending on definitions and context

**Avoiding Illogical but Not Alogical**:
- **Alogical** refers to statements that are not governed by logic, but do not contradict it
- **Illogical** is undesirable as it contradicts logic
- Being alogical is unavoidable and sometimes beneficial or crucial in understanding complex real-world situations.

#### Logical Implications of False Negatives and Positives in Decision Making

**Logical Implications of Social Services Debate:**
* False negatives: someone who deserves help but doesn't get it
* False positives: someone who doesn't deserve help but does get it

**Argument for Expanding Social Services:**
- Care more about false negatives than false positives
- Belief that expanding social services reduces false negatives

**Argument against Expanding Social Services:**
- Care more about false positives than false negatives
- Belief that reducing social services reduces false positives

**Clarification of Arguments:**
* False negatives and false positives at the heart of many disagreements
* Changing someone's core principle is key to agreement

**Motivational Mantra:**
* "Less likely to regret doing something and failing than not doing it and never knowing"
* Encourages doing things we shouldn't have done (false positive) over not doing things we should have done (false negative)

**Jetlag Strategy:**
* Deprive yourself of sleep in advance if better at staying awake tired
* Sleep well in advance if better at falling asleep tired.

#### The Power of Logical Conclusions and Abstraction

**Abstraction and Logic:**
- Abstraction: connects seemingly unrelated situations, making brain power more efficient
- Logic and discovery: logical implications follow from pure logic and have to be true
- Logical conclusions shed new light on existing information, not a discovery of new facts
- Archaeology analogy: unearthing ancient artifacts brings them to light
- Gradual revelation through logical implications (e.g., "If you are white then you have privilege")

**Kyle MacDonald's Challenge:**
- Internet legend who swapped a paper clip for a house
- Gradual realization of the value chain in bartering
- Initial trade: paper clip for coffee
- Subsequent trades: coffee > CD, CD > computer, computer > truck, truck > parcel trailer, parcel trailer > three acres of land, three acres of land > dream home.

#### "The Long Chain of Logical Implications: A Case Study and its Significance"

**Swaps and Logical Chains**

**MacDonald's Paper Clip Trade**:
- Traded a large red paper clip through a series of swaps
- Each trade was considered fair by the people involved
- Ended up with something quite different from his original item
- Built up a following online, causing consternation
- Final trade was for a two-story house in Kipling (population: 1140)

**Optical Illusions of Reasoning**:
- Long chains of logical implications can be surprising and far-reaching
- Each step seems logical but the final result is often unexpected
- Reminiscent of mathematical proofs that build up a long chain of implications

**Real Life Logical Arguments**:
- Every step should be a logical implication
- Similar to mathematical reasoning, but not exactly the same
- Example: Birth defects caused by poor science education in teachers

#### Understanding Mathematical Implications and Chains of Logic

**Duhigg's Study on Implications**
- **Paul O’Neill**: Young researcher who led a study later becoming CEO and US Secretary of Treasury
- Example of long chain of implications in normal life

**Understanding Implication in Mathematics**
- Importance of understanding mathematical logic: clear, concise arguments, bigger constructions
- Dryness makes things crisp and clear
- Mathematical language uses "implies" instead of "If ... then ..."
- Symbol used: **→** or **“implies”**

**Properties of Implication in Mathematics**
- If **A** is true, **B** must be true
- When **A** is false, no conclusion can be made about **B**
- Series of implications: A → B → C → D ...
- Proof: whole series of implications strung together like a chain

**Challenges with Following Chains of Implications**
- Takes more concentration and logic command than single implication
- Lack of understanding can result in errors or misunderstandings.

**Examples of Longer Chains of Implications**
1. If you believe women are inferior, you're insulting to them. (A)
   - If "feminine" is an insulting way to describe a man, women are considered inferior (B)
   - Thus, if you think "feminine" is an insult, you're insulting women (C)
2. If you don't stand up for minorities being harassed, you're complicit with bigotry. (A)
   - Letting bigotry flourish is complicit with it (B)
   - Being complicit in something bad makes you almost as bad (C)

#### Understanding Mathematical Proofs: Definition, Assumptions, and Groundwork

**The Consequences of Not Standing Up for Minorities:**
* If you don't stand up for minorities being harassed, you are almost as bad as a bigot
* This conclusion is true even if you are an ally and have stood up for minorities before
* The implication does not necessarily reflect your personal beliefs or actions

**Logical Implications:**
* Logical implications tell us that if certain conditions are met, a conclusion must be true
* These arguments can be built upon to form complex understanding
* Important in mathematics, where they are called "proofs"

**Setting Up a Mathematical Proof:**
1. **Define concepts carefully**: Clearly outline what is being discussed
2. **State assumptions**: Specify the conditions under which the result is true
3. **State objective of proof**: Make the desired outcome clear and unambiguous
4. **Check assumptions before applying results**: Ensure that conditions are met before using a result from a proof in a new context

#### Assumptions, Knowledge Problems, and Logical Arguments

**Problems in Arguments: Knowledge vs Logic**

**Problems of Knowledge**:
- Argument breaks down due to unstated assumptions or incorrect use of definitions
- Examples:
  - Assumptions about benefits (e.g., poverty only occurs due to laziness)
  - Assumptions about abortion (e.g., unwanted pregnancies only occur due to promiscuity)
  - Assumptions about depression (e.g., depression only occurs due to circumstances and not in successful people)
- Unstated assumptions: covering up lack of knowledge
- Incorrect definitions or usage: making arguments easier than they should be, leading to straw man and false equivalence arguments

**Mathematical Proofs vs Real Life Arguments**:
- Mathematical proofs have fewer failures due to strict logical rules
- Arguments in real life often contain unstated assumptions and incorrect definitions/usages.

#### Logical Fallacies and Implications in Arguments

**Problems of Incorrect Definitions:**
- Misunderstandings can arise from lacking or unclear definitions, such as arguments about immigration being confused between immigrants and illegal immigrants
- In normal life, definitions are sometimes left undefined leading to misunderstandings in discussions about topics like patriotism, sexism, feminism, or democracy

**Problems of Logic:**
- Gaps in logic: leaping from one statement to another without justifying it or leaving out steps between
- Incorrect inferences: making a logical step that is actually incorrect, where something is claimed to follow from something else when it doesn't
- Handwaving: arriving at conclusions without proper use of logic but by waving hands around to convince others
- Incorrect logic: subtle ways incorrect logic can be introduced as logical fallacies in arguments
- Emotions, such as yelling and insults, often accompany faulty logic in everyday arguments.

**Examples of Incorrect Logic:**
1. Agreeing scientists = conspiracy theory (Conclusion does not follow logically from fact that people are agreeing)
2. Blaming an innocent person for a tragedy without considering all factors (Leaving out the fact that the police shot them with little evidence or reason)

**Understanding Implications:**
- Implication only enables deduction of something from another, but does not determine truth of each level in argument
- Logical implication: X implies Y -> true if X is true
- To know that X is true, need something to imply it (W implies X)
- But what implies W? (V implies W) and so on.

#### The Role of Axioms in Logical Thinking and Disagreement

**The Process of Working Backwards**

**Origins**:
- Comparison to a child's constant questioning ("Why?")
- Infinite curiosity and tolerance for repeating the process
- Adults eventually stop asking "why" due to pragmatism and worldly responsibilities

**Avoiding Overwhelm**:
- Need to know when to stop asking questions and get on with daily life
- Drawing a line in logic: accepting facts without constant justification (axioms)
- Basic assumptions or beliefs that are not permanently justified

**Identifying Axioms**:
- Understanding one's own thought process and basic beliefs
- Differences in starting points lead to disagreements
- Both parties can be logical but still disagree due to different axioms.

### 3 The directionality of logic

**Chapter 3: The Directionality of Logic**

**Logical Fallacies**
- Being happy does not necessarily make you eat chocolate: time and causation flow in one direction only
- Legally residing in the US does not equate to being a US citizen: careful with logical assumptions

**Swaps and Implications**
- Reversing swaps may lead to incorrect conclusions (e.g., "you have privilege" ➔ "you have white privilege")
- Privilege can come in various forms, even if not related to race or gender: "you are a woman" ➔ "you have experienced sexism" vs. "you have experienced sexism" ➔ "you are a woman" (different questions)
- Everyday Sexism project: all women experience sexism, which is different from claiming that only women experience it.

#### Converse Implications and Broccoli Bribes

**Implications and Converses**

**Background:**
- Logical implications vs. statements
- "If you eat your broccoli, you can have ice cream" is an example of an implication statement

**Implications**:
- If A implies B, then A guarantees B
- If A is true, B must also be true

**Converses:**
- Reversing the arrow between A and B creates a new statement
- This new statement is called the converse of the original

**Broccoli and Ice Cream Example**:
1. Original statement: **If you eat your broccoli, you can have ice cream.** (guarantees that broccoli leads to ice cream)
2. Parent's response: **You can eat ice cream only if you eat broccoli.** (guarantees that broccoli is necessary for ice cream)
3. Converse of the original statement

**Logical Implications vs. Converses:**
- Logical implications ensure both guarantees to child and parent
- Distinction between "if" and "only if" can be pedantic, but important in formal logic.

#### Using Arrows and Venn Diagrams in Logic Understanding

**Implications and Converses**
- Equivalent statements: "if A then B" and "B if A" (logically)
- Arrows illustrate flow of logic
- Converse of "A implies B" is "B implies A" (different, not reversed)
- Flexibility in English grammar with if/then statements can be confusing

**Mathematical Notation and Venn Diagrams**
- Notation simplifies complex ideas
- Implications and converses demonstrated using arrows
  - True: A → B
  - False: B → A
- Converse of A → B is B → A (logically, but emotionally questionable)

**Using Venn Diagrams for Logic**
- Pictures help capture abstract concepts
- Analogies aid understanding by summarizing important aspects
- Manipulating pictures in mind aids research process.

#### Logical Implications: Multiple Expressions and Venn Diagrams

**Venn Diagrams as Visual Aids for Understanding Logical Implications**

**Benefits of Venn Diagrams**:
- Help make the transition between "dry logic" and feelings
- Reward us by bringing us closer to the truth
- Useful for basic situations, especially when things get complicated

**Limitations of Venn Diagrams**:
- Not so useful if you have more than about three sets, as they get too chopped up
- Help us see the **directionality of implications**

**Examples of Logical Implications**:
- If you are from England, then you are from the UK
- If you have white privilege, then you have privilege
- If you are a US citizen, then you can live in the US legally

#### Avoiding Logical Fallacies in Communication and Thinking

**Convergent Statements vs. Converse Errors**

**Convergent Statements**:
- Eight different ways of stating "A implies B"
- All convergent statements have the same logical meaning
- Example: "We only shoot black people" is equivalent to "If we shoot you, then you are black"

**Converse Errors**:
- Mistaking the converse of a statement for the original statement
- Logically independent from the original statement
- Example: Thinking that working hard guarantees success (not necessarily true)

**Examples of Convergent Statements and Converse Errors**:
1. If you are a US citizen, then you can legally live in the US (true logical implication)
   - Converse: If you can legally live in the US, then you are a US citizen (false)
2. If you have a university degree, then you are intelligent (questionable)
   - Converse: If you are intelligent, then you have a university degree (questionable)
3. If you have experienced prejudice, then you are a woman (false)
   - Converse: If you are a woman, then you have experienced prejudice (true, but not the only case)

#### Logical Equivalence and Its Implications for Communication

**Obamacare vs Affordable Care Act (ACA)**
- **Obamacare** is an informal name for the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**
- Therefore, supporting Obamacare means supporting ACA, and vice versa
- People may object to supporting something labeled with Obama's name, even if it's the same thing as something else
- This demonstrates that how a concept is presented can significantly impact perceptions

**Logical Equivalence**
- When two statements are **logically equivalent**, they hold true in both directions: A  implies B and B implies A
- Examples of logical equivalence:
  - **A** is true if and only if **B** is true
  - **A** is a necessary and sufficient condition for **B**, and vice versa
  - **A** is logically equivalent to **B**, and **B** is logically equivalent to **A**
- Logical equivalence does not imply emotional or semantic equivalence
- False equivalence occurs when two things are assumed to be logically equivalent when they are not (e.g., having a degree vs being intelligent)

#### Understanding Prejudice, Systemic Oppression, and Logical Fallacies

**Sexism and Prejudice:**
* Exploring definitions: oppressed groups vs. oppressors (Chapter 13)
	+ Instances of bias towards oppressors not equal to control over the oppressed group
	+ Abstract understanding of difference essential
* Profiling and prejudice (Chapter 12)
	+ Rational vs. racist: population size determining grey areas
	+ Originally intended for non-white people, not white people
	+ Venn diagrams vs. Euler diagrams: semantic debate

**Sexism:**
* Definition debated in relation to systematic oppression
* Instances of bias towards oppressed groups not equal to control over them

**Prejudice and Profiling:**
* Differences between rational and racist approaches
* Population size affects complexity of question
	+ Gradual shift from logical to racial
* Venn diagrams vs. Euler diagrams: semantic debate on definitions

**Logical Equivalence:**
* Statement's meaning the same doesn't guarantee truth or moral justification
* White people can be victims of police violence, but questions regarding disproportionate impact and racism are more complex.

### 4 Opposites and falsehoods

**Debating and Negation**

**School Debates**:
- "This house believes that Margaret Thatcher should go"
    - Relevant due to her subsequent resignation
- "This house believes that strawberries are better than raspberries"
    - Pointless and contentless debate topic

**Arguments and Logic**:
- Arguments often consist of someone claiming something is true, and the other person arguing that they're wrong
- First person attempts to justify their claim with a logical argument
- Second person can either:
    - Find a flaw in the logical argument
    - Construct their own logical argument to back up their assertion

**Negation and Logic**:
- Negation is how we argue against things
- Logic, mathematics, and science are ways of finding out what is true or not true
- Admitting the possibility of being wrong and having ways to detect it is important for rational thinking

**Effective Arguments**:
- Arguing against things in normal life often degenerates into insults, intimidation, or yelling
- This is likely due to frustration with one's own failure to get a point across
- Most people can do better than this and may want to be persuaded to try

**Negation vs. Opposite**:
- Negation is the logical concept of negating a statement (i.e., claiming it is false)
- Opposites are not always logically equivalent (e.g., "strawberries are better than raspberries" and "raspberries are better than strawberries")
- Understanding negation and opposites can help build logical power and understand multiple perspectives on the same idea

#### Understanding Logical Opposition vs. Language Opposites

**Opposing Viewpoints on Education Systems**
- **Measured and calm opposition**: I don't think the Asian education system is better than British one.
- **Extreme and excited opposition**: No way, the British education system is better.

**Negation vs Opposite in Logic:**
- **Negation**: Denying the original statement as true (e.g., "It's not true that...")
- **Opposite**: Saying something that goes against or contradicts the original statement but may not be its logical negation (e.g., "the Asian education system is terrible")

**Examples:**
1. EU:
   - Original statement: "I think the EU is fantastic."
   - Negation: "I do not think the EU is fantastic."
   - Opposite: "I think the EU is terrible."
2. Margaret Thatcher:
   - Original statement: "Margaret Thatcher was the greatest Prime Minister."
   - Negation: "Margaret Thatcher was not the greatest Prime Minister."
   - Opposite: "Margaret Thatcher was the worst Prime Minister."
3. Climate Change:
   - Original statement: "Climate change is definitely real."
   - Negation: "Climate change is not definitely real."
   - Opposite: "Climate change is definitely fake."
4. Sugar:
   - Original statement: "Sugar is good for you."
   - Negation: "Sugar is not good for you."
   - Opposite: "Sugar is bad for you."

**Considerations:**
- What are the education systems aiming to do?
- How are they measuring what they achieve?
- What do we want an education system to accomplish?
- Different perspectives may lead to various interpretations of better/worse or negation vs opposite in everyday language.

#### Black and White Thinking: Challenges of Dealing with Grey Areas

**Understanding Opposites vs Negations**

**Differences between Opposites and Negations:**
- **Opposites**: exact opposite extremes or polar opposites
- **Negation**: not having a quality, canceling it out

**Examples**:
- Gender: "I am male" vs "I am female" vs "I am not male" (potentially intersex)
- Race: "Barack Obama is black" vs "Barack Obama is white" vs "Barack Obama is not black"

**Grey Areas**:
- People struggle with grey areas in arguments
- Arguments often focus on opposites instead of negations
- In reality, most things have both good and bad aspects
- Logic can also struggle with grey areas
- Including grey areas in debate is important to represent reality accurately.

#### Racial and Sexual Identity: Logical and Social Implications

**Race and the Flawed Notion of Black and White**
* The concept of race is flawed, including the idea that "white people" are not black
* Arbitrary cut-offs for defining race: one drop, quarter, eighth ancestry or none at all
* Exclusion of mixed-race people, Asians, Native Americans, and others from discussion
* Logical approach: considering both black and not black or white and not white
* Problem with focusing on extremes and ignoring the grey area
* Alternative approaches: arbitrary line in the middle or designating a "grey" area

**Racial Issues and Privilege**
* White privilege extends to some mixed-race people who can "pass" as white
* Calling everyone non-white an "other" can be a symptom of white supremacy
* Middle ground: acknowledging the existence of the grey area between black and white.

**The Complexity of Sexual Orientation**
* Extreme examples: exclusively hetero or homo attracted individuals
* Middle ground: bisexual individuals, but where do we draw the line?
* Questions remain regarding definitions and labels for sexual orientation.

#### Navigating Grey Areas: Considering Negation and Venn Diagrams

**Power Imbalance and Identity:**
* Everyone entitled to self-identify (race, sexuality)
* Importance of context: power imbalance skews the scale (history of oppression)
* Black people and gay people have more at stake in classification systems
* Logic simplifies situations but can overlook important aspects of context
* Discussion on dealing with grey areas comes back in Chapter 12

**Venn Diagrams:**
* Used for understanding sets and logical statements
* White people: outside of the circle = non-white people
* Problem of grey areas and law of excluded middle
* Dividing circle depends on concepts being considered (location within or outside the circle)

**Truth Values:**
* Simplification vs simplistic thinking
* Ignoring crucial details is counterproductive to understanding
* Keep pertinent illuminating details while forgetting irrelevant ones.

#### Understanding Logical Truth Values and Paradoxes

**The Law of Excluded Middle**

**Awareness of Forgetting**:
- Being aware of what you're forgetting allows you to:
  - Recognize the limitations of your actions
  - Avoid situations you shouldn't get into

**Truth Values**:
- The law of excluded middle states there is no truth value between 0 (false) and 1 (true)
- This is a simplification, as:
  - There are decimals between 0 and 1 that could represent partial truth
  - Fuzzy logic allows for this concept of partial truth
- The law of excluded middle treats truth as binary (yes/no) or numerical values

**Truth Tables**:
- Truth tables are a useful way to encapsulate logic
- They can help engage the logical brain and develop new intuition about logic

**Truth Values of Negation**:
- If A is true, then its negation is false
- If A is false, then its negation is true

#### Negating Implications and Faulty Arguments in Logic

**Limitations of Current Human Knowledge**
- Some statements have uncertain truth values due to current limitations
- Examples:
    - The universe is finite
    - We will one day cure all cancer
    - A meteor caused the extinction of the dinosaurs

**Negating Implication**
- Tricky to negate implication statements
- Not true: "If you have privilege then you are not white"
- Logical negation: "Having privilege does not imply that you are white" or "It is not true that if you have privilege then you are white"
- Inferences from faulty implications can lead to errors

**Faulty Arguments and Implications**
- Example of a faulty argument regarding white privilege:
    - Some black people are better off than you, even if you are white
    - Conclusion: Therefore I don't have white privilege
- This argument is flawed as it only considers exceptions, not the overall systemic privilege

#### Understanding Contrapositives: A Tool for Logical Flexibility

**Understanding Contrapositives**

**White Privilege Argument**:
- "A" is true: "If some black people are better off than a white person then that person does not have white privilege."
- "B" could be false due to either:
  - A being false (not true for all black people and white person in same circumstances)
  - "A implies B" being false (misunderstanding of what white privilege means)

**Contrapositives**:
- Logically equivalent statements
- Formally, contrapositive is "B is false if A is false"
- If original statement is true, contrapositive is also true
- If original statement is false, contrapositive is also false
- Not to be confused with converse (A implies B) or negating A and B individually (A is false, B is false).

**Negation and Implication**:
- Flexibility in understanding comes from seeing things from different but equivalent points of view
- Negation interacts with implication to provide this flexibility

**Examples**:
- "If you travel abroad you must have a passport." (original statement)
  - Logically equivalent to "If you don't have a passport you can't travel abroad" (contrapositive)
- "If you are a US citizen then you can legally live in the US." (original statement)
  - Not logically equivalent with "If you are not a US citizen then you can't legally live in the US" (converse)
  - Mistake people make when negating A and B individually.

#### Logical Implications, Contrapositive, and Evidence in Science

**Contrapositive vs Negation**
- Logical implication is more powerful than a piece of evidence:
    - Logical implication means something is definitely true
    - Piece of evidence contributes to probability of truth
- Evidence doesn't contribute to logic, only justifications can
- Example: "Being of Chinese origin implies being good at maths"
    - Contrapositive: "Not being good at maths implies not being Chinese"
    - Every non-Chinese, non-mathematician should add to theory according to this logic

**Negation in Science**
- Scientific experiments start with a hypothesis, an unproven statement
- Hypothesis can be about something already known for a long time
- School science experiments often contrived and lack motivation
- One successful experiment: Hooke's Law (spring constant of spring)

#### Understanding Scientific Hypotheses and Probability in Experiments

**Hypothesis and Evidence:**
- The extension of a spring is proportional to the load that is hanging from it (Hooke's law)
- Scientists collect data through experiments to support or refute hypotheses
- Statistics determines required evidence for logical conclusions
  - Sufficient evidence: "This hypothesis is true, to within 95% certainty"
  - Insufficient evidence: "There is not sufficient evidence to suggest this hypothesis is true, to within 95% certainty" (not the same as false)
- Scientific laws are established hypotheses proven with high levels of certainty
  - Different from logical truths
- Percentage certainty in scientific experiments:
  - Less than 50%: jury is out, do not act based on it
  - Over 95%: likely to be true but still a small chance of false
- False positives and false negatives depend on seriousness of situation
- Scientific method, statistics, and probability interact

**Optical Illusion:**
- White circle appears more grey in outer ring due to our perception
- Metaphorically represents the demarcation between white and non-white in our minds
  - Sliding scale rather than distinct categories.

**Gender Identity:**
- Personal gender identity matches sex assigned at birth: cisgendered.

### 5 Blame and responsibility

**Chapter Overview: Blame and Responsibility**

**Flight 3411 Incident**:
- United Express Flight 3411 was overbooked
- Passenger was forcibly removed, causing injury
- Opinions were divided on who was at fault:
    - United's unreasonable use of force
    - Passenger's refusal to leave

**Contributing Factors**:
- Everything in life is caused by multiple factors
- Humans tend to blame one factor rather than understanding the interconnectedness

**Blame and Responsibility**:
- Blame is tied to responsibility
- If no individuals are blamed, does that mean no one takes responsibility?

**Breakdown of Relationships**:
- When relationships break down, blame is often placed
- Contributing factors from both sides lead to the collapse

**Interconnectedness**:
- The student's and teacher's contributions combine to cause the outcome
- It's not always clear who is at fault due to interconnectivity

**Case Study: Failing Student**
- Student's grades were poor, leading to blame being placed
- However, both the student and teacher contributed to the situation
- Understanding all factors and their connection is key

#### Understanding Logical Connectives in Everyday Life

**Understanding Logical Connectives**

**The Importance of Logical Connectives**:
- When two factors combine to cause a result:
    - Either factor alone could change the result if it was different
    - The combination of the two factors caused the result
- Logical connectives are the way logical statements are connected to form complex statements

**Understanding Complex Statements**:
- Breaking down complex situations into simple constituent parts is a good approach
- Logical connectives are the way of sticking together simple logical statements into complex wholes

**The Meaning of "And" and "Or"**:
- **And**: Both A and B are true
    - Example: "The student didn't work hard enough and the teacher didn't teach well enough"
- **Or**: A or B is true
    - Example: "The student worked harder or the teacher taught better"

**Avoiding Logical Mistakes**:
- "And" and "or" are often misused with implication and negation
- These words cause logical mistakes, especially when combined

**Understanding Statements in Everyday Life**:
- In real life, the word "and" may not be explicitly stated, but can be made explicit
    - Example: "He's a white man" -> "He's white and he's a man"
- Occasionally, clarification is needed even in normal language
    - Example: "He's a black cab driver" in the US context vs. "black cabs are not a concept in the US"

#### Understanding "Or" in Mathematics: Exclusive vs Inclusive Meaning

**Or vs And**
- In mathematics, "or" is more complex than "and"
  - Mathematically, "or" joins two statements A and B to make a new statement "A or B"
  - The new statement is true if either A or B (or both) are true
  - This differs from the normal usage in English where "or" often excludes the possibility of both
- Example: Paying excess baggage fees on a plane
  - If luggage is too heavy OR too big, you still have to pay extra (inclusive or)
  - This differs from "tea or coffee" situation where you can only choose one (exclusive or)

**Exclusive vs Inclusive Or**
- In logic and mathematics, we need to make the distinction between exclusive and inclusive or
- **Exclusive Or**: Excludes the possibility of both being true
  - Example: "Would you like tea or coffee?"
- **Inclusive Or**: Allows for both statements to be true
  - Example: Paying excess baggage fees on a plane

**Venn Diagrams**
- Can be used to illustrate the difference between exclusive and inclusive or
- Example: People who earn less than average (black people, women, those who are both black and women)
  - The region of overlap in the middle represents where both conditions are true (the intersection)

#### Negation of "And" and "Or" in Propositional Logic

**Income Disadvantage and Logic Operations**

**Defining Income Disadvantage**:
- Not limited to black people who are not women or vice versa
- Includes both groups, as well as those who belong to neither category
- Region shown in Venn diagram as the union of the two sets:
  - White people who are not men
  - Men who are not white
  - People who are neither white nor men

**Negation of "And" and "Or"**:
- Causing an outcome is not the same as preventing it
- If two factors cause an outcome, only one needs to change to prevent it
- Negating a statement involving "and":
  - Consists of three regions:
    1. White people who are not men
    2. Men who are not white
    3. People who are neither white nor men
- Negating a statement involving "or":
  - You are at an inherent disadvantage if you are black or female
  - To escape this disadvantage, you must be neither black nor female

**Negation of "And" vs. "Or"**:
- Original statement: You are black and female
  - Negation: You are not "black and female" (could be either or neither)
- Original statement: You are black or female
  - Negation: You are not "black or female" (must be both negated to mean neither)

**Importance of Inclusive "Or"**:
- Ensures a satisfying relationship between "and" and "or" when negating each other
- Mathematicians prefer this type of "or" for its neat logical properties.

#### Understanding Blame and Systemic Responsibility in Complex Situations

**Blame and Responsibility:**
- **Negating "and" statements**: negating one factor negates the whole statement
- **Glass example**: both dropping the glass and its hardness contributed to breaking it, neither alone is to blame
- **Privilege example**: losing any privilege doesn't make one more "to blame" than others
- **System understanding**: focusing on system interactions instead of individual blame
- **Blame in "An Inspector Calls":** a woman's death resulted from multiple factors, not just one person's actions.

#### "Divorce: The Interplay of Blame and Forgiveness"

**The Role of Blame and Responsibility in Relationship Breakdowns**

**Divorce**:
- Not a fully logical statement that "affair implies divorce"
- Breakdown can occur if one person does not forgive the other for an affair
- Factors contributing to relationship breakdown:
  - **A**: Alex had an affair
  - **B**: Sam does not forgive Alex
  - **C**: They both refuse to go to couples therapy
  - **D**: Couples therapist was not very good
- Possible underlying causes:
  - **Alex**: unhappy due to neglectful partner, or inherent character traits
  - **Sam**: neglected the relationship, struggling with personal tragedies or grief, etc.
- **General principle**: One person's happiness can cause the other person pain in a zero-sum game scenario
- Toxic relationships may stem from this dynamic where one person's gain leads to another person's loss

#### Understanding Maths Phobia and Airline Incident: The Interplay of Factors in Education System and Aviation Industry

**Factors Contributing to Maths Phobia:**
- **Problems with the education system**:
    - Arbitrary standards imposed on teachers
    - Testing and exam pressure
    - Lack of maths specialists in primary schools
    - Teachers' own past experiences with maths
    - Parental attitudes towards maths

**Factors Contributing to Incident on United Airlines:**
- **Flight was unexpectedly overbooked**:
    - Four volunteers needed seats on the flight
    - No one volunteered, so they asked for volunteers
    - When no one volunteered, they chose passengers to remove

- **Security officers' use of force**:
    - Passenger refused to leave his seat
    - Officers dragged him off the plane

**Additional Arguments:**
- **United Airlines' unreasonable policy**:
    - Overbooking flights
    - Forcing passengers to give up their seats

- **Passengers' responsibility**:
    - Fault for not being aware of overbooking risks
    - Fault for missing flights that require volunteers

**Conclusion:**
- Multiple factors contribute to incidents and issues, including education systems and airline policies.

#### Analyzing the United Airlines Controversy's Complex Causation

**Situation Analysis of United Airlines Incident:**

**Background:**
- Overbooked flight during holiday weekend or urgent crew needs
- Offer of money to passengers to voluntarily give up seats declined
- Passenger removed using excessive force by security officers

**Questions Raised:**
1. Why was the flight overbooked? (Holiday weekend, staffing urgency)
2. Why did United not offer more money? (Penny-pinching or oversimplified reasoning?)
3. Why did they choose that particular passenger? (Elite status, other factors)
4. What were the "other factors" in their decision? (Racial profiling?)
5. Why did the passenger decline? (Shift at hospital)
6. Was he to blame for taking the shift? (Yes/No)
7. Why did staff call security? (Threatening behavior or overreaction?)
8. What led up to the situation: economics, statistics, psychology, industry practices

**Importance of Asking "Why":**
- Reveals complex web of causation in situations
- Avoids oversimplification and blame on single factor
- Helps identify important factors for effective analysis.

#### Understanding Complexity and Responsibility in Interconnected Systems

**Logical Sloppiness and Complex Systems**

**"End of Story" Phrase**:
- Indicates a lack of understanding of complex systems
- Rarely the end of the story

**Examples**:
- "It's that guy's fault for not doing what he was told, end of story."
- "If you don't want to be injured being dragged off a flight, just get off the flight when you're told. It really is that simple."
- "Fact: if that guy had followed the crew's instructions he wouldn't have been hurt."

**Complexity of Situations**:
- Many situations are much more complicated than they appear
- **Interconnected Factors**: Election results, weight gain, etc.

**Blame and Responsibility**:
- "And" situation: Everyone involved collectively caused the outcome
- Change requires responsibility from all parties
- Aim to understand interconnectedness for productive change

**Logical Rationality**:
- Don't just aim to be logical, but use logic effectively
- Understand complex systems as a whole

**"Either... or..." vs. "Both or Neither"**:
- "Either... or..." is a natural concept
- "Both or Neither" is more complex

### 6 Relationships

**Relationships and Vicious Cycles**

**Principle of Interactions**:
- Examining how things or people relate to one another is key to understanding a situation
- Important at many levels and scales, from international relations to personal relationships

**Vicious Cycles**:
- Example: Emotional eating and weight gain
  - **Emotions** (stress, upset, anger) cause overeating
  - Overeating causes further **emotions** (stress, upset, anger)
- Breaking the cycle:
  - **Feelings**: Difficult to control (e.g., feeling stressed about work)
  - **Actions**: Easier to change (e.g., not eating when upset)
- Domestic meltdown example:
  - Arrows represent different needs and emotions (e.g., love, respect)
  - Escalation can occur quickly
- Breaking the cycle:
  - Both parties should make efforts
  - More mature person should break the cycle first (according to "Love and Respect" by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs)

#### Understanding Vicious Cycles and Breaking Them Using Category Theory

**Vicious Cycle of Police Brutality Against Black People**

**Summary**:
- Analogy between vicious cycle and broken arrows: which arrow to break - actions or feelings?
- Debate on changing police behavior vs. community relations
- Importance of understanding the cycle as a whole, not oversimplifying it to one root cause

**Actions vs. Feelings**:
- Black people being shot even when following orders from police
- Police training in de-escalation
- Power holders taking responsibility for breaking cycle

**Category Theory**:
- Focus on relationships between things
- Different lenses of thinking: age, years of service, hierarchy
- Discovering insights from various perspectives

**Factors of 30**:
- List of numbers can be boring in one dimension
- Natural geometry in higher dimensions
- Factors of 30 and their relationships.

#### Primes, Factors, and Set Relationships: A Hierarchical Diagram

**Prime Factors and Hierarchy**

**Family Tree of Prime Factors:**
- Structure has a cubic shape
- Not based on size of numbers alone
- Level 1: 1 (no prime factors)
- Level 2: 2, 3, 5 (prime numbers)
- Level 3: Numbers with two prime factors
- Top level: Number with three different prime factors

**Examples:**
- 30 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 2 × 3 or {1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3}
- 42 = 2 × 2 × 7 × 2 × 3 or {1, 2, 2, 7, 2, 3}

**Prime Factors vs Size Hierarchy:**
- Hierarchy comes from prime factors, not just size
- Write numbers as sets of prime factors instead
- Multiplying numbers in each position returns the actual diagram of factors

**Abstract Diagram:**
- Applicable to any three objects (a, b, c)
- Arrows represent omitting an element from the set.

#### Hierarchy of Intersecting Privileges: White, Male, Rich

**Privilege: Understanding Hierarchies and Their Impact**

**Three Types of Privilege:**
- Rich
- White
- Male

**Hierarchy Diagram:**
1. **Rich (White, Male)**
2. **White (Rich or Poor, Male or Female)**
3. **Male (Rich or Poor, White or Non-white)**
4. **Poor (Any race, Any gender)**
5. **Non-white (Any race, Any gender)**
6. **Female (Any race, Any privilege level)**

**Observations:**
- Hierarchy shows number of types of privilege, not amount
- People in top row have all three privileges
- Arrows indicate direct loss of a type of privilege
- Vertical arrows: loss of privilege moving from one group to another with same attributes
- White privilege doesn't mean one group is always more privileged than another but implies improved status for having certain privileges

**Examples:**
- Rich black sports stars vs. poor white homeless women
- Police brutality against black people versus white people doing the same thing

**Additional Observations:**
- Hierarchy in second row does not represent equal status
- Money mitigates other problems
- Women granted some status before black people, leaving an ongoing legacy on society

**Historical Causes of Inequality:**
- Not the purpose of this discussion.

#### Understanding Privilege through Context and Analogies

**Cube of Privilege Diagrams:**
* Comparison between absolute privilege within each row and between rows
* Tension between number of types of privilege (arrows) and overall privilege (height)
* Rich black women may be more privileged than poor white men
* Disagreement leads to animosity among underprivileged groups within white men
* Context affects inter-relationships: "rich, white, cis" as types of privilege for women
* Understanding context crucial for addressing issues of privilege and oppression.

**Cube of Privilege Diagrams:**
* Depiction of relative privilege using two different perspectives
* Absolute privilege shown by height on the page vs number of privileges (arrows)
* Anger and animosity result from disagreements between these two viewpoints
* Poor white men feel underprivileged despite having more privileges than some groups
* Same is true for other underprivileged groups within white men
* Clear context essential for understanding inter-relationships

**Context Switching:**
* Rich white cis women occupy top position in new context (women's experiences)
* Anger towards rich white cis women among feminists or women activists
* Importance of considering multiple types of privilege and contexts.

**The Empty Set Symbol:**
* Standard symbol for the empty set
* Technical reasons behind choosing 1 as product of no prime factors.

### 7 How to be right

**Understanding Scope and Accuracy in Communication**

**Misleading Communications**:
- Example from "Chicken Run" where a rooster makes a misleading deal with rats about eggs
- The rooster was truthful, but the statement was imprecise, leading to confusion

**Emotional vs. Logical Statements**:
- Emotional outburst: "Men are sexist pigs."
  - May not mean all men are sexist pigs, but rather an emotional response
- Importance of expressing true emotions, not just making accurate logical statements

**Sweeping Statements**:
- Examples: "You never do the washing up," or "You always leave a mess in the kitchen."
  - These statements are imprecise and may provoke arguments rather than addressing underlying feelings

**Importance of Clarity**:
- Sweeping statements often stem from emotional responses that need to be addressed directly
- It's more productive to express specific emotions or experiences instead of generalizations.

#### The Art of Careful Qualification in Communication

**Sweeping Statements:**
- Ambiguity in statements like "all people" or "most people"
- Refine scope for precision: focus on specific world of objects
- Use qualifiers like "almost all", "most", "some", "in my experience" to make statements less ambiguous and defensible
  - Example: "Mozart is more boring than Brahms" vs. "In my opinion, Mozart is more boring than Brahms"
- Carefully qualified statements are precise in correctness but may not make good headlines
- Media often overstates research findings to make headlines more sensational

**Statement Analysis:**
- Sweeping statement: "New research shows that sugar causes cancer."
- Finding truth by applying the right qualifiers:
  - Scientific research shows no evidence that homeopathy works better than placebo
  - Pro-homeopathy person may be experiencing placebo effect, not logical disagreement with anti-homeopathy person.

#### Understanding Quantifiers and Negations in Logical Statements

**Logic and Qualifying Statements**
- **Basic logic**: doesn't handle nuances better than emotional outbursts
- Two logically unambiguous ways to qualify statements:
  1. The statement is true of everything in your world (e.g., "all mathematicians are awkward")
  2. The statement is true of at least one thing in your world (e.g., "there is at least one mathematician who is friendly")
- Compare statements: "Everyone in the US is obese" vs. "Someone in the US is obese"
  - The second statement narrows the scope to just the US and then checks if it applies to someone, even if everyone else doesn't match (vacuous truth)

**Rocky's Eggs**
- Rocky promised all his eggs to the rats, which was technically a "for all" clause (all zero eggs were given to the rats)
  - This is called **vacuous truth**, or a condition being vacuously satisfied
- Example: "All the elephants in the room have two heads" is a false statement that still satisfies the "for all" clause, because there are no elephants and all zero of them have two heads.

**Negating Statements**
- To refute a "for all" statement, you need to show that there exists someone in the set who does not match the statement:
  - **Negation of**: For all X in the set of men, X is a sexist pig
    - There exists X in the set of men, such that X is not a sexist pig
- This means you just need to find one man who is not a sexist pig.

#### The Logician's Bar Joke and Perceptions of Mathematicians

**Mathematical Joke and Logicians' Behavior:**
- Three logicians enter a bar
- Bartender asks if everyone wants a beer
- First two logicians answer "I don't know"
- Third logician answers "Yes" on behalf of everyone
- Joke highlights the logical process of verification and refutation for universal statements
- Humorously showcases precision in thinking among mathematicians

**Mathematicians and Stereotypes:**
- Sweeping statements are dangerous as they can be misleading or untrue
- Portrayal of mathematicians in popular culture often skewed, portraying awkwardness and social issues
- Author disagrees with the stereotype, stating that he is a mathematician but notawkward
- The statement "All mathematicians are awkward" is problematic as it can be taken to imply the author is not a mathematician or is still awkward despite being an exception.
- Author takes offense at such statements and finds them overly simplistic, preferring to focus on individual cases rather than generalizations.
- Overanalysis vs Underanalysis: The difference lies in whether it provides new insights or not. The author believes that "overthinking" is often a misnomer for deep analysis that leads to better understanding.

#### "Quantifiers in Logic: Scope and Precision"

**Negation of Quantifiers**

**Explanation:**
- Negating a statement involving "for all" requires checking every element to ensure no truth exists (not possible)
- Negating a statement involving "there exists" only requires finding one counterexample.

**Example**:
1. **World**: All female science students in time, original statement: For all female science students X, X has been hit on by their supervisor.
   - Negation: There exists a female science student X such that X was not hit on by their supervisor.
2. World: All female science students in time, original statement: There exists a female science student X such that X has been hit on by their supervisor.
   - Negation: For all female science students X, X has not been hit on by their supervisor.
3. **Precise Quantification**: Using phrases like "In my opinion...", "In my experience..." can make statements less prone to misinterpretation.
4. **Qualifiers**: Adding terms such as "Maybe", "Sometimes", "Apparently" can provide clarity and context.
5. **Teaching Mathematics**: Teaching maths may not always be effective in eliminating math phobia; some cases might be better left unattempted.
6. **Precise Language**: Using phrases like "There is a sense in which..." can help focus attention on the specific meaning of statements.
7. **Higher Order Logic**: Predicate or first-order logic involves quantifiers that only go over sets, not higher levels of expressivity causing self-reference issues.

### 8 Truth and humans

**The Limits of Logic**

**Understanding Logic's Limitations**:
- Acknowledge that logic has its limits
- Logic is not the ultimate answer to everything
- Logic can be used effectively within its limits
- Recognize when to apply logic appropriately

**Mathematical Proof as a Social Construct**:
- Mathematical proofs are rooted in logic, but not purely logical
- The starting points for mathematical proofs (axioms) are assumptions without justification

**The Paradox of Logical Justifications**:
- Strictly logical proofs are impossible to write down due to:
  - Dependence on agreed rules of logic
  - Impracticality beyond a certain level of complexity
- We extend ideas from mathematical reasoning to justify ourselves to others

#### Fractal Approach in Proving Mathematical Theorems

**Chapter 10: Limitations of Logic**
* Trial by jury: when logic isn't powerful enough
	+ Insufficient information or time
	+ Conveying truth to others
* Mathematicians use broad brush stroks for long proofs
* Writing a book: planning and outlining
	+ Fractal approach: self-similarity and infinite detail
	+ Represents how finding a proof works in the mind
		- Base: thing you're trying to show is true
		- Two main factors that logically imply it
			* Think about each factor, what causes them to be true
			* Repeat process for subfactors until gaps are filled and branches are close enough together.

#### Flaws in Proofs and Peer Review in Mathematics and Law

**Mathematical Proofs and Peer Review:**

**Branching Fractals**:
- Branching further would not be distinguishable, so it's not truly infinite
- We can stop at a point where showing the fractal to another person is sufficient

**Proof Process**:
- Proofs involve justifying things further until convinced or fundamental beliefs differ
- Similar to trial by jury: proof is about convincing a jury of peers
- Flawed system as people are susceptible to emotions and bias

**Peer Review in Mathematics**:
- Peer review involves checking logical consistency of proofs
- Peers may fill gaps to ensure logical completeness
- Disagreements arise when mathematicians cannot see how to fill the gap
- Original author must provide convincing explanations

**Limitations of Proof and Peer Review**:
- Definitive proof is unlikely in complex cases
- Burden of proof lies on presenting logical arguments, not just emotions
- Peers can be swayed by reputation or personal bias
- Anonymous review may not be feasible due to recognition within the community
- Researchers present work at conferences for feedback before publication.

#### Navigating the Intersection of Logic and Emotion in Mathematics

**Mathematics and Its Limits**

**Limitations of Mathematical Proofs**:
- Mathematicians may not want to admit sociological and human aspects of math outside mathematical circles
- Overstating the remit and achievement of a system can cast doubt on all of it
- Mathematics is powerful and relevant, but has limits

**Interaction Between Logic and Humanity**:
- Research papers include material not strictly logical to help mathematicians understand proofs
- Dealing with scepticism is an important part of the mathematical process
- Reasonable objections need to be justified in peer review, unlike audience votes

**Reasonable vs. Unreasonable Objections**:
- Audience vote competitions can bypass the need for justifying objections
- In a court of law, jury decisions are not always based on logic and may require no justification

#### Overcoming Intuitive Objections in Mathematics and Beyond

**Politicians and Corporations:**
- **Peer Review**: Elections for politicians, money for corporations
- Results don't necessarily reflect logical arguments or sound methods
- Easy to be manipulated emotionally
- Importance of remaining skeptical

**Reasonable vs. Unreasonable Skepticism:**
- Logical objections: gaps in logic, addressed through clear reasoning
- Intuitive objections: contradict personal beliefs, harder to resolve
  - Changes required for intuition
  - No definitive way of convincing someone
- Difference between logical and intuitive objections in mathematics research

**Intuitive Objections:**
- Can't be dismissed outright
- Root cause identification necessary for resolution
- Perspective change may help resolve the conflict
- Acknowledging the validity of the objection important

**Importance of Skepticism:**
- Understanding a sceptical person's perspective in advance
- Preempting situations and removing reasonable skepticism.

#### Truth and Illumination in Argument and Discussion

**Imagining Sceptical Peer Reviewers**
- We are allowed to imagine that peer reviewers are as intelligent as us (peer review vs idiot review)
- They are highly sceptical of what we're saying or actively trying to find mistakes
- Imagining someone sceptical can test our logic and open new ways of thinking
- Important skill for building bridges in discussions rather than widening divides

**Testing Arguments**
- Seek out different viewpoints to understand their perspective
- Read reasonable articles and guess objections from comments section
- Disagreements often come from fundamental beliefs or knee-jerk reactions

**Truth vs Illumination**
- Not all truth is relevant or helpful (truth vs illumination)
- Logic can assess truth, but illumination cannot be measured
- Equations are not lies per se, but the statement "Equations are all lies" was meant to grab attention

#### Understanding the Illuminative Nature of Mathematical Equations

**The Myth of Equations Being Only About Numbers**

**Equations vs. Lies**:
- Most equations are not lies, but they are hiding something not equal
- Trivial equations are pointless and do not provide new insight
- The author means that all enlightening equations are in fact hiding differences between the left and right sides

**Commutative Law for Addition**:
- 10 + 1 = 1 + 10 is an example of a useful but not truly equal equation
- Children have difficulty recognizing commutativity of addition
- High-level mathematics treats 1 + 10 and 10 + 1 as different, yet equivalent
- The equation provides insight by showing that the processes may be different but yield the same answer

**Purpose of Equations**:
- Equations show two things that are the same in some way despite differences
- Useful equations reveal equivalence between seemingly different concepts
- Truly equal equations (x = x) are unilluminating and provide no new information.

#### Understanding Emotional vs Intellectual Knowledge in Mathematics Learning

**The Role of Logic and Emotion in Convincing People**

**Logical Truth vs. Understanding**:
- Logical truth is not always illuminating
- In practice, logic often does not convince us initially
- We use gut instinct, hunches, and imagery to start building proofs
- Logic is used to fill in the gaps, but intuition gets us started

**Understanding Logical Proofs**:
- **Logical proofs** are accompanied by informal explanations
- These descriptions help us understand the logic
- Examples, diagrams, and analogies aid in comprehension
- Feeling why something is true helps us understand the logical steps

**Intellect vs. Emotion**:
- Knowing something intellectually vs. emotionally can be different
- A lag between intellect and emotions is normal
- Learning through experience embeds knowledge deeper

**Memorization in Mathematics**:
- Some argue memorization is necessary for math success
- Others claim they never memorized anything in math
- Understanding, rather than memorization, is the key

#### Emotions as Catalysts for Logical Understanding

**Discussing Memes and Scientific Communication**

**Background:**
- Author is not an expert in arithmetic but understands its basics
- Emotional engagement enhances logical truth's convincing power

**Memes as a Form of Communication:**
1. Memes can be illuminating without being true
2. Internet meme example: Scientists vs Politicians
   - Scientists identify a problem
   - Politicians debate existence of the problem or solutions
3. Emotional engagement in scientific communication
4. Memes go viral due to catchy phrases and humor, not facts
5. Importance of simplifying complex arguments
6. Engaging emotions with logical arguments

**Scientific Communication:**
1. Scientists should express uncertainty when presenting a problem
2. Politicians should debate funding for proposed solutions
3. Memetic approach to scientific communication:
   - "How it Should Be": Scientists identify issue, propose solutions; politicians debate funding
   - "How It Actually Is": Scientists identify issue, politicians debate existence of the issue
4. Balancing logic and emotions in scientific communication
5. Emotional engagement enhances the convincing power of logical truths.

### 9 Paradoxes

**Paradoxes: Logic's Contradictions**

**To Do Lists**:
- Avid writer of to do lists
- Useful way to procrastinate
- Can put easy tasks on list for quick accomplishment
- Putting "Do something on this list" leads to confusion

**Loops and Contradictions in Life**:
- Wanting to give unsolicited advice but fearing it's unsolicited
- Inability to keep ice cream in the house, leading to eating all of it
- Serious contradiction: online form requiring full name without hyphen, but passport has hyphen

**Paradoxes and Logic**:
- Occur when logic contradicts itself or intuition
- Limitation of strictly logical thinking
- First case: need to be more careful with logic, definitions, scope
- Second case: don't necessarily trust intuition, understand its source

**Exploring Paradoxes**:
- Illuminates limitations of logic and understanding of the world
- Some paradoxes lead to huge developments in mathematics
- Curious situations where pursuing logic too hard causes contradictions

**The Liar Paradox**:
- Declaring "I'm lying" creates a paradox: if true, it's false; if false, it's true
- Classic paradox with historical significance in mathematics.

#### Logic Paradoxes in Carroll's "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles"

**Carroll's Paradox**

**Background:**
- Logical paradox explored by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) in "What the Tortoise Said to Achilles" for Mind journal
- Based on Zeno's paradoxes
- Explores logical implications and infinite regress

**Key Concept:**
- Logic has a limit: we need to assume some rules to use it
- Carroll's paradox is about what happens if we don't start with these assumptions
- Infinite regression of logical steps without a conclusion

**Dialogue Between Tortoise and Achilles:**
1. **Tortoise**: Compare two sides of a triangle to see if they are the same length
2. **Achilles**: They both measure 5 cm, so they're equal
3. **Tortoise**: This is true only if A implies Z (equal sides have same length)
4. **Achilles**: Yes, A implies Z
5. **Tortoise**: Does A and B imply Z (A equals, B implies A implies Z)?
6. ...and so on, leading to infinite statements
7. Question: Does A, B, C, …, n imply Z?
8. The paradox arises when we can't reach a conclusion through an infinite series of logical implications.

#### Zeno's Paradoxes: Exploring Motion and Infinity

**Zeno's Paradoxes**

**Background:**
- Greek philosopher Zeno proposed paradoxes around 5th century BC
- Aimed to understand fundamental aspects of studying the world, not just understanding it

**The Tortoise and Achilles Paradox**:
- Achilles in a race with tortoise
- Tortoise has head start
- Zeno argues that Achilles will never overtake the tortoise due to infinite regression of distances covered
- However, we know that Achilles will eventually win the race in reality

**Paradox Breakdown**:
- A : I dropped the glass
- B : **A** implies **Z** (glass was too fragile)
- C : **A** and **B** imply **Z** (floor was too hard)
- D : **A**, **B**, and **C** together imply **Z** (gravity intervened)
- E : **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, and **F** together imply **Z** (nobody else caught the glass)
- F : **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E**, and **G** together imply **Z** (...)
- **Z**: The glass broke

**Modus Ponens**:
- Rule of inference used to deduce anything from anything else
- Assumed to be valid to get anywhere

**Zeno's Paradoxes**:
1. Tortoise and Achilles
2. Traveling from A to B
   - Zeno argues that we will never reach our destination due to infinite regression of distances covered
   - However, in reality, we do succeed in traveling to places every day.

#### Zeno's Paradoxes and Hilbert's Hotel: Infinities and Logical Conundrums

**Zeno's Paradoxes**
- Third paradox: arrow flying through air, nothing can be seen moving at any given instant
- Veridical vs falsidical paradoxes
  - Veridical: no logical issues, but seem to contradict our view of the world
  - Falsidicial: logical errors hidden in the argument
- Zeno's paradoxes are falsidical
- Error comes from interpreting "forever" and combining infinitely small things

**Infinitely Large vs Infinitely Small Things**
- Taking care with both is important
  - Infinitely large: when valid to add up an infinitely long string of numbers
    * Adding up all numbers leads to paradoxical results
    * Not as simple as adding finitely many finite things
- Infinitely small: questions about sliding scales and grey areas (Chapter 4)

**Hilbert's Hotel Paradox**
- Thought experiment with an infinite hotel and infinite people
- Neither the hotel nor the people exist in real life, but used for analysis of infinitely large concepts.

#### Infinite Supply and Hilbert's Paradox: Implications for Digital Media

**Hilbert's Hotel Paradox**

**Guest Accommodation**:
- No rooms available for new guest
- Move everyone up a room (e.g., person in room 1 to room 2, etc.)
- Leave room 1 empty, new guest can move in

**Intuition vs. Reality**:
- Paradox challenges our intuition about infinity
- Infinite number of rooms, unlike finite numbers in real life

**Infinity as a Number**:
- Extends to thinking about more guests and infinite guests
- Leads to study of infinity as a new type of number

**Infinitesimally Divided Distances**:
- Any distance can be divided into infinitely many smaller distances
- Critical for understanding motion and automation

**Unlimited Supply**:
- Hilbert's hotel has an unlimited supply of hotel rooms
- Extra copies of digital media can be made with no incremental cost

**Value of Digital Media**:
- Plummeted to zero or close to it due to infinite supply
- Piracy argument: prevent "stealing" to restore finite supply
- Counterargument: copying digital content is not the same as stealing

**Infinite Supply and Moral Issues**:
- Infinity theory can't directly address moral issues
- Provides clearer terms for discussing them

#### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem Explained

**Gödel's Paradox and Incompleteness Theorems**

**Background:**
- Kurt Gödel (1906-1978): logician who proved limitations of mathematics
- In 1931, Gödel established incompleteness theorems
- Shocking discovery for mathematicians at the time

**Incompleteness Theorems:**
1. Any consistent logical system is doomed to have statements that can neither be proved nor disproved
2. Axioms built up precisely in a system do not contain contradictions and are self-referential
3. Large, interesting systems like arithmetic of whole numbers exhibit this property
4. First-order logic is complete (everything provable or false) but second-order logic is not
5. Problems arise from self-reference leading to logical loops
6. Gödel's theorem discusses self-referential paradoxes using formal mathematical proofs

**Implications:**
- The belief that the mathematical world is perfectly logical and everything can be proven was challenged by Gödel
- Incompleteness theorems revealed that even in a mathematical system, there are unprovable statements
7. **Gödel's theorem**: statement about self-reference creating paradoxes proved formally using numbers
8. The theorem discusses logical structures and their connections to abstract structures in music, art, and mathematics (Bach, Escher).

#### Russell's Paradox and its Impact on Mathematics

**Gödel's Paradox**
- **Mathematical statement**: Gödel showed that it is possible to make a mathematical statement using the language of arithmetic, showing any mathematical system including arithmetic must be incomplete.
- **Incomplete systems**: There are smaller mathematical systems complete but they don't include arithmetic and can't claim to be all of mathematics.
- **Impact on mathematicians**: Some mathematicians were outraged by the conclusion, refusing to believe it despite finding no logical errors in the proof.

**Russell's Paradox**
- **Background**: Bertrand Russell was a philosopher and mathematician who raised questions about keeping levels separate. His paradox dates from 1901.
- **The paradox**: Imagine a male barber in a town who shaves all the men who do not shave themselves, and nobody else. Who shaves the barber? The paradox arises because if the barber does or doesn't shave himself, two contradictory statements result.
- **Implications**: The paradox shows that mathematical systems can have inconsistencies, leading to a challenge for mathematicians. However, this has largely been resolved.

#### Russell's Paradox and Tolerance: A Battenberg Cake Approach

**Russell's Paradox:**
* Paradox arising from sets that contradict themselves
* Formal statement: set S of all sets not belonging to themselves
* Is S a member of itself?
	+ If yes, then it isn't
	+ If not, then it is
* Highlights the need for careful definition in set theory
* No such set S can exist
* Prevented by careful axiomatization of set theory
* Different levels of sets to avoid self-referential statements

**Tolerance:**
* Personal goal: be tolerant and open-minded
* Question: tolerance towards hateful, intolerant views?
* Subtle form of Russell's paradox
* Narrow the scope of "all things"
* Qualification: tolerant of all things that do not harm others
* Battenberg cake structure: two negatives make a positive
	+ Not not hungry = hungry
* Addition of odd and even numbers
* Multiplication of positive and negative numbers
* Tolerance and intolerance:
	+ Tolerant of tolerance is tolerance
	+ Intolerant of tolerance is intolerance
	+ Tolerant of intolerance is intolerance
	+ Intolerant of intolerance is tolerance.

#### Resolving Tolerance Paradox with Levels of Knowledge and Ideas

**Tolerance and Open-Mindedness: Resolving Paradoxes through Levels of Ideas**

**Background:**
- Discussing tolerance and open-mindedness using mathematical paradoxes as an analogy

**Battenberg Grid for Tolerance**:
1. Things
2. Ideas about things
3. Meta-ideas (ideas about ideas)
4. Meta-meta-ideas (ideas about meta-ideas)
5. ...

**Levels of Tolerance:**
- Be tolerant of people's ideas, but not necessarily their meta-ideas

**Logical Thinking in Everyday Life**:
- Logical thinking is applicable to various aspects of life including personal interactions with illogical humans

**Russell's Paradox and Tolerance:**
1. Russell's paradox: set S (set of all sets not members of themselves) leads to a logical collapse if A is both in and not in S
2. Avoiding the logical collapse by distinguishing ordinary sets from meta-sets (levels of ideas)
3. In the context of tolerance, this means applying different levels of acceptance for regular ideas versus meta-ideas.

**Implications**:
- Shared knowledge and meta-knowledge at all levels are crucial in addressing manipulative behaviors like sexual harassment or other forms of harm
- Communication between victims is essential to bring down perpetrators, especially when dealing with hidden information or meta-levels of knowledge.

### 10 Where logic cant help us

**Cardiac Surgeon Stephen Westaby on Limits of Logic in Emergencies**

**Five Minutes for Decision Making**
- Heart stops: brain damage within 5 minutes
- Logical analysis may not be feasible due to time constraints
- Patient may already be brain dead by the time a conclusion is reached

**Limitations of Logic**
- Logic requires information as fuel
- Insufficient resources or time limits logical analysis
- Human behavior makes predictions uncertain

**Role of Emotions and Intuition**
- Beyond logic's constraints, emotions and intuition are crucial
- Understanding logic's limitations important

**Language: A Logical yet Exceptional System**
- Contains logical rules with exceptions
- Origins of language rooted in etymology and gradual development
- Ultimately traces back to a starting point that cannot be explained

**Complexities of Learning New Languages**
- Frustration from numerous rules and exceptions
- Some languages more logical than others, but still have exceptions
- Pronunciation often illogical or inconsistent.

#### The Origin and Nature of Inspiration

**Starting Points and Flash of Inspiration**

**Sound Symbolism in Language:**
- Some words resemble the sounds they represent: "cuckoo", "cat"
- Memorization vs. immersion for language acquisition
  * Difficulty: quantity of vocabulary to learn
  * Speaking requires quick access to words from a deep place in consciousness
  * Learning by desire and emotional connections

**Origin of Language:**
- Not based on logical associations
- Children learn through repetition and imitation
- Memorization doesn't guarantee usage

**Flashes of Inspiration:**
- Moments of unexplained ideas or creative insights
- Art, music as common sources
  * Music: thematic development, harmonic structure, polyphony, symmetry
    * Techniques used by great composers like Bach and Schoenberg
  * Lack of proficiency in these techniques makes it difficult for some to compose creatively.

#### Logic's Limitations: Navigating Decision Making Beyond Logical Choices

**Why the Author is Not Prolific:**
- Strict rules in writing lead to fewer possibilities for expression (like Bach's harmony)
- Rules in sport leave infinite possibilities within constraints
- Structural rules for Shakespeare's sonnets have huge scope for choices and expression
- Math and logic can inspire ideas, but testing their robustness comes afterward

**Where Logic Ends:**
- Even with logical starting points (axioms), decisions may not be fully determined
  - Example: Choosing a menu item within budget and preference constraints
    - Multiple plausibly logical choices remain
  - Life is complicated and unknowable, leading to indecision
- Ways to make a decision:
  - Add more axioms to narrow down possibilities
  - Try something new or different based on a whim.

#### Making Logical Decisions Under Pressure: Emergencies and Instinct

**Decision Making:**
- When making decisions: consider needs, preferences, or instincts
- In emergencies: make rapid decisions based on instinctive reactions

**Logic vs Instinct:**
- Instinctive reactions not illogical in emergency situations
- Can be expressed as a series of logical deductions
- Overwhelming fire example: "A is true", "B implies C", therefore "C" (I must get out)
- Internalization of logical processes leads to quicker access via feelings
- Logic can be embedded deeply into consciousness for faster retrieval.

**Logical Thinking vs Instinctive Reactions:**
- Logical thinking: slower, requires conscious effort
- Instinctive reactions: faster, instinctual

**Deepening Logical Understanding:**
- Convert logic into feelings for deeper understanding
- Accessing things by feelings is often quicker than logic.

#### Limits of Logic: Complexity and Insufficient Data Challenges

**Insufficient Information**

**Logical Limits:**
- Lack of information can hinder logical decision making
- Menus: Decide based on limited available information
- Emergencies: Insufficient time for logical deductions or gathering info
- Sport: Can't measure all necessary data before acting
- Chess: Massive number of possible combinations, impossible to calculate logically
- Weather forecast: Complex system with sensitive fluctuations
- Economics: Human reactions not entirely predictable

**Examples:**
- Voting in first-past-the-post systems: Complicated due to need to guess how others will vote.

**Insufficient Data:**
- Limited data availability hinders logical conclusions
- Weather forecast: Data sensitivity requires consideration as "chaotic" system
- Economics: Human behavior not entirely predictable from available data

**Complex Systems:**
- Complex systems have numerous interactions, making logical understanding difficult or impossible.

**Implications:**
- Lack of information and uncertainty hinders logical decision making in various aspects of life.
- Understanding the world entirely logically may be unattainable due to insufficient data and human behavior factors.

#### The Prisoner's Dilemma: A Test of Trust and Rationality

**The Prisoner's Dilemma:**
* Difficulty of trusting others based on limited information
* Two individuals (Alex and Sam) face a decision: remain loyal or betray each other to reduce their own sentence
	+ Prosecutor offers plea bargains with different outcomes depending on the choices made
	+ If they both stay loyal, they will serve one year each
	+ If Alex testifies against Sam, Alex goes free while Sam gets ten years
	+ If Sam testifies against Alex, Alex gets ten years and Sam is let off
	+ If they both testify, they each get five years
* Trust plays a significant role in this decision
	+ Both parties must trust that the other will remain loyal to avoid serving more time
	+ Lack of trust may lead one or both individuals to betray each other, resulting in longer sentences
* The prisoner's dilemma illustrates how logic and trust are intertwined and can be challenging to navigate.

#### Dominant Strategy and Cooperative Dilemmas: Prisoner's Dilemma and Climate Change

**Prisoner's Dilemma:**
- **Game Theory**: logic of game reveals dominant strategy to betray in certain scenarios
- **Rewards**: £1000 for denouncing group, £500 for not denouncing
- **Probability of Nobody Denouncing**: unlikely
- **Dominant Strategy**: betrayal leads to better outcome in all scenarios
- **Collaboration**: essential for everyone's benefit

**Climate Change:**
- **Cooperation**: all countries collaborate on emissions reduction
- **Cost and Benefit**: cost of cooperation vs global benefits
- **Defection**: one country refuses to cooperate, gains most from others' cooperation
- **Logic of the Prisoner's Dilemma**: expect everyone to defect due to individual gain
- **Reality Check**: belief in climate change and its effects, impact on decision making.

#### Overcoming the Logic Limit: Trust and Cooperation in Groups

**Commons Dilemma vs. Prisoner's Dilemma**

**Commons Dilemma**:
- Focuses on ongoing situations and different timescales of benefit
- Group can use a common resource in moderation, but if one person overuses it, they can deplete it, causing detriment to the whole group

**Prisoner's Dilemma**:
- Focuses on the logic and suspicion causing a system to collapse
- Individuals may act selfishly, leading to negative consequences for everyone

**Trust and Cooperation**:
- Trust and cohesion in a community allow them to cooperate and go against game theory logic
- The larger the group, the more fragile trust is
- Trusting both logic and human aspects can result in better outcomes

**Beyond Logic's Reaches**:
- Logic cannot explain and decide everything in the world
- We must trust in non-logical aspects as well
- Non-logical things are not necessarily bad

### 11 Axioms

**Axioms and Logic**

**Limitations of Logic**:
- Logic itself has no starting point
- We must start somewhere to apply logic

**Axioms**:
- Basic rules in a system that generate other truths
- Not proven, but accepted or chosen as basic truths

**Approaches to Axioms**:
1. **Internally Motivated**:
   - Choose axioms and explore the logical system they generate
   - Any axioms are valid within this assumed system
   - Problems arise if the axioms cause contradictions, leading to a null system
2. **Externally Motivated**:
   - Axioms based on observed facts or values
   - Validity of the axioms is not necessarily logical, but derived from experience

**Thought Experiments with Axioms**:
- Imagining a world where no gender pay gap exists
  * Huge numbers of men would be removed from positions of power due to false accusations
  * Replacing women's fear of sexual harassment with men's fear of false accusations
- Considering the implications of an internally motivated system without gender or power dynamics

#### Axiomatizing Personal Beliefs: Understanding Core Assumptions

**Axiomatization: Understanding Basic Truths**

**External Approach:**
- Starting point: world we are trying to understand (numbers, shapes, relationships, etc.)
- Goal: find basic truths that generate all other facts
- Example: Euclid's axiomatisation of geometry with five rules

**Internal Approach:**
- Starting point: setting up new country and its fundamental laws

**Characteristics of Good Axioms:**
1. **True**: based on undeniable facts
2. **Basic**: cannot be broken down into smaller parts
3. **Few**: preferably minimal number, but clarity over brevity
4. **Illuminating**: reveal important aspects of the structure
5. **Non-redundant**: avoid duplicate information

**Axiomatisation in Mathematics:**
- Analogous to personal beliefs
- Boiling down beliefs to fundamental truths
- Logical consistency essential for a valid system

**Personal Axioms:**
- Individual's core beliefs, similar to mathematical axioms
- Originate from personal experiences and reasoning
- Differences can result in varying perspectives.

#### Personal Axioms and Their Origins: A Logical and Empathetic Approach

**Understanding Personal Axioms: Where They Come From and How to Identify Them**

**Identifying Personal Axioms:**
- Start with beliefs: ask "Why do I believe this?"
- Uncover deep logic behind beliefs through questioning ("Why?")
- Requires logical proficiency and self-awareness

**Understanding Someone Else's Axioms:**
- Logical proficiency + empathy necessary
- Interplay between logic (understanding) and emotion (empathy)

**Personal Axioms:**
1. **Kindness**: Belief in being kind to people, leading to beliefs about helping others, contributing to society, education, equality, and fairness.
2. **Knowledge**: Trust in frameworks for accessing knowledge in various disciplines such as scientific research or historical research.
3. **Existence**: Pragmatic belief that we exist (despite some uncertainty) to get on with life.

**Acceptance of Starting Points:**
- Accept some starting points in logical system
- Important for getting anywhere; clarity about them helps identify beliefs and understand disagreements.

**Philosophical Question:**
- Where did these axioms come from? (More philosophically complex)

#### Fundamental Beliefs: Origins and Justifications

**Belief Formation:**
- **Upbringing**: instills values and beliefs from parents
- **Society**: influences through cultural norms
- **Education**: expands worldview, shapes opinions
- **Life experience**: shapes beliefs based on personal incidents
- **Personal conviction**: derived from life experiences

**Fundamental Beliefs:**
- Can be traced back to religion for some individuals
- Source of fundamental beliefs: parents, education, traumatic events, influential figures

**Axiomatization of Beliefs:**
- Taking every belief as an axiom: ineffective and lacks logical deduction
- Point of axiomatisation: understand the roots and cohesion of a system

**Extreme Beliefs:**
- Some individuals hold complex beliefs without adequate justification or explanation.

#### Philosophical Foundations and Logic of Beliefs and Analogies

**Beliefs and Their Underlying Foundations**
- Beliefs are rooted in something beyond logic (fundamental beliefs)
- Abstraction can help uncover more fundamental beliefs
  - Example: belief in taxation and social services is rooted in a belief that false negatives are worse than false positives
- Human existence is connected to communities, with collective responsibility for success and misfortune
- Fundamental belief in understanding things in terms of systems rather than individuals
- Belief in personal responsibility, but also looking after each other
- Many grey areas exist where logic can't fully apply
  - Differentiating true logical equivalence from false equivalence is a challenge
- Analogies help pivot between dissimilar things by finding common ground
- Deciding when analogies are appropriate or pushed too far is crucial.

**Logical Fallacies and Grey Areas**
- False equivalence: widespread logical fallacy where things appear the same but aren't
- Understanding grey areas vs forcing them to be black and white
  - Logic deals with grey areas in various ways, some undesirable (e.g., pushing to extremes)
  - Things may start out seeming "the same" but gradually morph into something different

### 12 Fine lines and grey areas

**Grey Areas and Human Nuances:**
* Brain's ability to process grey areas
* Avoiding extremes: dealing with uncertainty
* Pitfalls of drawing a line
	+ Understanding Elizabeth Austen's perspective in Pride and Prejudice
	+ Gradual development of being in love
	+ Human experience vs logic
* Ambiguity exists between black and white
* Importance of grey areas
* Effects of rigid logic: extremes, certainties
* Everyday language pushing towards extremes.

#### Navigating Grey Areas: Dealing with Life's Complexities

**Understanding Grey Areas:**

**Worries about Black and White Thinking**:
- Concern for the world's reliance on certainties that may be flawed
- Need to embrace different ways of dealing with grey areas
- Become better at navigating nuances instead of longing for black and white clarity

**Extreme Thinking: The Cake Example**:
- Logical reasoning leading to eating excessive cake
- Difficulty drawing a clear line between "sensible amount" and "too much"
- Children's attempts to push arbitrary lines, such as bedtime
- Arbitrary lines in grey areas can be challenged with illogical thinking (believing all the logical implications of beliefs)

**Deductive Closure**:
- Set of statements is deductively closed if it contains everything that can be logically deduced from those statements
- Belief in all implications is important for being a logical human being

**Dealing with Grey Areas:**
- May need to abandon the most obvious logical approach
- Embrace more complex ways of handling grey areas
- Arbitrary lines are drawn based on the severity of consequences, providing a buffer zone from extremes.

#### Drawing Lines in Grey Areas: Race, Exams, Sexual Harassment

**Drawbacks of Setting Lines in Grey Areas:**
- Difficult to determine where to draw the line due to subjectivity (roller coaster height requirement vs cake consumption)
- Consequences can be severe (injury or death for roller coasters, weight gain for cake)
- Contentious debates occur about fairness and unfairness (grade boundaries in exams)
- Lines tend to shift further down over time
- Difficulties arise when dealing with people who do not respect boundaries (sexual harassment)

**Contentious Grey Areas:**
- **Race**:
  - "Black" and "white" are shades of brown and pink, not literal distinctions
  - Obama's classification as "black" acknowledges privilege for those who appear white
  - Difficulty determining where to draw line between black and white
    * Nearer the white side: could exclude non-whites as "other"
    * Further from the white side: could acknowledge privileges of white people

**Sexual Harassment:**
- Difficult to determine seriousness of misconduct before taking action
- Challenging for those who are generous and want to help others
- Importance of setting boundaries and respecting personal space.

#### Defining Healthy Boundaries and Body Mass Index

**Boundaries and Harassment**
* Difficulty determining line between friendly and harassing behavior
* Shoulder vs. back vs. other body parts - where do we draw the line?
* Vulnerability and power differentials complicate situation
* Reporting minor infringements may be dismissed as overreaction
* Escalation of small actions can lead to serious harm
* Importance of setting clear boundaries
	+ Protects from dangerous behavior
	+ Prevents manipulation by others
	+ Allows for personal safety
	+ Not necessarily ungenerous

**Body Mass Index (BMI)**
* Measure of healthiness based on weight and height
* Flaws: doesn't account for muscle mass
* Muscular athletes may have high BMI due to muscle density
* Personal acknowledgment of own physical condition is important.

#### Arbitrary Weight Guidelines and Mathematical Induction

**BMI and Weight Management:**
* I don't need calipers to know I have fat despite hiding it well (23)
* Arbitrary lines drawn for healthy weight in terms of BMI: 25 for women (24 is safer)
* Doctors may use BMI as guideline, but I insist on taking off shoes if over 25
* Reasonable weight gain can be misleading, leading to significant annual increase in weight
* Treating the line itself as hazy: stay below it for effective weight management (around 24)

**Mathematical Induction:**
* Principle of mathematical induction: if true for number 1 and able to climb by 1, then true for all whole numbers (3)
* Babies learn to climb up one step, discover they can go up flights of stairs using the same method (4-5)
* Mathematical induction is logically secure; climbing steps metaphorically represents proof that something holds true for larger sets (6-7)
* Small cookies: fine to eat 1 cookie, okay to eat 1 more if it was fine before, so fine to eat any number of cookies (8-9).

#### Fuzzy Logic and Truth Scales in Decision-Making

**Mathematical Induction**
- **Property P(n)** stated for each whole number n
- Prove P(n) true by showing P(n) = P(n+1), then P(n) is true for all whole numbers

**Challenges with Sliding Scales and Fractions:**
- Difficulty proving properties for numbers between whole numbers or with no smallest unit of jump
- Example: Comparing sizes of cookies
  - Students may think cookies are "more or less the same size" based on small differences in weight
  - However, this can lead to large discrepancies over time

**Fuzzy Logic:**
- Allow for more nuanced levels of truth between 0 and 1 instead of just "true" or "false"
- Can be dangerous as it may suggest truth is negotiable
- Useful for dealing with probability and grey areas where certainty is not possible

**Fuzzy Logic vs Percentage Probabilities:**
- Fuzzy logic measures extent to which something is true, while percentage probabilities measure degree of confidence in truth value.
- Weather forecasts often provide percentage likelihood of rain during each hour, which can be interpreted as amount of rain expected
  - 90% chance of rain: likely to be heavy rain
  - 40% chance of rain: might be a light rain or none at all.

#### Intermediate Value Theorem & Cookie Making for Dynamic Control

**Understanding Truth Values and Grey Areas**

**Marking Examinations:**
- Clear cut results: pass or fail (no uncertainty)
- Extent of truth can still vary

**Fuzzy Logic:**
- Used for dealing with grey areas in control systems
- Gradations between true and false
- Example: rice cookers, heating, air conditioning

**Defining Grey Areas:**
- Accept that line is somewhere in the grey area
- Set bounds to determine range of acceptable values

**Intermediate Value Theorem:**
- Applies to continuous functions with a start and end value
- Function must take every value in between
- Helps deal with fine lines and uncertainty.

#### Exploring Perception and Identity: Mixed Race Categorization

**Intermediate Value Theorem and Perception of Reality**
- **Art Student's Exploration**: creating visual illusions to understand people's perceptions of reality
- **Grey Area**: finding the point where people are unsure if an image is real or digitally manipulated
- **Chocolate Cocoa Content**: similar principle as gradations in race
- **Historical Context**: "white" and "non-white" categories; need for more finely tuned racial classification

**Modern Racial Classification**
- **Mixed Races**: between white and non-white, or other combinations
  - **Examples**: blasian (black and Asian), Mexippino (Mexican and Philippino)
- **Quarter vs. Three Quarters**: different classifications for someone who is one quarter Asian and three quarters white versus three quarters Asian and one quarter white
- **Advantages and Disadvantages**: choosing the right classification system
  - **Simple**: "white people" and "Asian people", but excluding some individuals
  - **Detailed**: avoiding bizarre anomalies, but creating a more complex society.

**Personal Preferences**
- **Chocolate Percentage**: the author's preference is between 80% to 100%, depending on mood
- **Cookie Size**: unknown exact percentage of population that prefers this size
- **Art Student's Findings**: there will be a point where people are unsure if an image is real or digitally manipulated.

#### Bridging Divides through Analogies and Nuanced Understanding

**Understanding Grey Areas and Bridging Gaps**

**Challenges of Black and White Thinking:**
- Extreme positions can result from logical incremental steps
- Discounts people's experiences with racial discrimination
- Ignoring grey areas may lead to misunderstandings

**Acknowledging Grey Areas:**
- Fuzzy logic, probabilities, hazy lines as solutions
- Embracing nuanced ways of dealing with complex world
- Building bridges towards better understanding

**Exploiting Grey Areas:**
- Incremental progress through small steps
- Learning new skills: piano playing example
- Bridging opposing ideas: social services and self-responsibility

**Understanding Difficult Arguments:**
- Comparing with more understandable analogous ones
- Pushing a principle to extremes to encompass disagreements
- Drawing people onto the bridge that is the grey area (subject of coming chapters).

### 13 Analogies

**Abstraction and Analogies**

**Abstraction**:
- Removing details from real world to reveal commonalities in abstract world of ideas
- Not logical itself, requires making choices about what to focus on
- Leads to different ways of understanding the same situation
- Similarity between situations is emphasized and treated as concept in its own right (analogy)

**Analogies**:
- Similarity between two different situations
- Taken seriously and studied as concepts in their own right
- Arrows represent process of going from general/abstract to specific instance

**Abstraction vs. Reality**:
- Abstract world sheds light on real world but is not the real world
- Something is lost or distorted when moving back to real world

#### Abstracting Analogies: A Framework of Comparison Levels

**Analogies and Abstract Thinking**

**The Role of Number Two:**
- Enables pivoting from one situation to another
- Helps find logic without explicit abstract analysis
- Making an analogy is a way to understand abstract principles

**Levels of Abstraction in Analogies:**
1. Concrete Level: Comparing specific concepts A and B
2. Abstract Level 1: Comparing abstract versions of concepts A and B (e.g., addition vs multiplication)
3. Abstract Level 2: Drawing analogy between binary operations, including addition, multiplication, etc.

**Understanding Analogies:**
- Choosing the appropriate level of abstraction for understanding a situation
- Maths becomes more abstract as it progresses
- People may lose interest at different levels of abstraction.

#### Abstraction Levels: Finding Balance for Analogical Understanding

**Importance of Finding the Right Level of Abstraction**
- **Lesson from PhD Supervisor Martin Hyland**: Importance of finding appropriate level of abstraction for situation
- Shining a light at an appropriate distance to see details and context
- Forgetting irrelevant details while retaining truth

**Consequences of Inadequate Abstraction**
- Overlooking critical details that might be crucial to the situation
- Limiting ability to draw links between more things

**Example: Analogy Between Fruits and Chairs**
- At "2 fruits" level, only analogy between 2 apples and 2 bananas is recognized
- To include "2 chairs", need to go up further to "2 things" level

**Cube of Privilege Example**
- Starting with cubes for factors of 30 and 42
- Realized that analogy applies to many more things by thinking of it as a cube of subsets of {a, b, c}

**Benefits of Abstract Thinking**
- Enables drawing analogies between seemingly unrelated ideas
- Allows pivoting further from initial idea and encompassing more concepts
- Applicable to concrete real-life situations

**Challenges with Abstraction**
- Divisive arguments often arise due to differing levels of abstraction used
- Importance of considering multiple levels of abstraction for a nuanced answer.

#### Personal Axioms: Prioritizing False Negatives Over False Positives

**Finding Axioms through Analogies**

**Understanding Personal Beliefs:**
- Discovering fundamental beliefs from which all our beliefs stem: personal axioms
- Thinking about analogies can help us understand our own or someone else's personal beliefs

**Personal Axiom Example**:
- Belief in helping people, regardless of background or situation
  - Social services and affirmative action
  - Education and university entrance
  - Screening for cancer
  - Sexual harassment

**Belief Clarification:**
- False negatives are more important than false positives
  - Implicit analogy between various scenarios

**Level of Abstraction:**
- Going to the top level enables clarifying thoughts and distilling belief process
- Helps apply thinking to more situations, explain it succinctly, and reason with it better.

#### Testing Principles: Analyzing Analogies for Bias

**Principles and Analogies**

**Compulsory Voting**:
- Disagreed with principle at first, thinking it means "obligation" to vote
- Later realized it's about ensuring everyone can vote, reducing voter suppression and disenfranchisement
- Example of false positives vs false negatives:
  - Without compulsory voting, risk false negatives (people unable to vote)
  - With compulsive voting, risk false positives (forcing people to vote who don't want to)

**Testing Principles**:
- Analogies enable testing principles
- If a principle doesn't hold in an analogous situation, it may not be a true logical principle
- Example:
  - Claiming sexism was not the issue with Hillary Clinton, as other male politicians lie also
  - If inexperienced man gets support, principle is not being applied consistently

#### Engaging Emotions Through Analogies in Argumentation

**Engaging Emotions through Analogies:**
* Use analogies to connect emotions with logical arguments (Bridson, 2021)
* Example: Science vs religion debate (Bridson, 2021)
	+ Scientists may feel uncomfortable as they ask people to believe in science without evidence, similar to how religious leaders ask believers to accept their teachings without questioning (Bridson, 2021)
	+ Both situations involve trusting an external source of knowledge (Bridson, 2021)
* Nuanced principle for distinguishing science and religion: focus on reproducible evidence (Bridson, 2021)
	+ Reproducibility ensures reliability in both fields (Bridson, 2021)
* Engaging emotions through analogies can strengthen arguments and understanding (Bridson, 2021).

#### Empathy Through Power Relationship Analogies

**Understanding Perspectives: Power Relationships**

**Power Relationships:**
- Helps us comprehend others' viewpoints
- Explanation of personal points of view to others

**Analogies**:
- Useful for understanding power dynamics
- Illustrates the concept of a privileged and oppressed group

**Men and Women's Roles:**
- Some men feel frustrated by sweeping statements about their gender
- Privileged position: Oxford/Cambridge graduates, men, Asians
- Understanding through analogy pivot

**Power Relationships Analogy**:
* Top group > bottom group
* Everyone experiences both privilege and lack of privilege

**Importance of Self-Awareness:**
- Be aware of how power dynamics affect us and others
- Avoid hypocrisy when addressing issues within different groups.

**Power Relationships Examples:**
1. Men's frustration with sweeping statements about their gender
2. Oxford/Cambridge graduates feeling misunderstood due to privilege
3. Asians experiencing both sides of racial discrimination

**Understanding Power Dynamics:**
- Being less privileged than someone else: white women, non-Oxbridge students
- Being more privileged than someone else: white gay men, Asian people (in comparison to other non-white groups)

**Pivot Perspective**:
- Perform pivots between different situations
- Understand both the privileged and less privileged perspective.

#### Bridging Political Divides: Finding the Grey Areas in Analogies

**Extreme Analogies for Understanding Principles**

**Analogies as Shocking Insights**:
- Analogies can engage emotions by pushing principles to an extreme
- This can challenge the fundamental nature of a principle

**Examples of Extreme Analogies**:
- Universal healthcare: Opponents argue we should have no police, military, or basic infrastructure if we believe in self-responsibility
- Healthcare vs roads: Disagreements come down to where to draw the line between government and individual responsibility

**Scope of Principles**:
- Extreme analogies reveal the limits of general principles
- Difficulty lies not in establishing principle but in determining its scope
- Differences can be quantitative rather than qualitative, requiring bridging grey areas

**Choosing the Right Level of Analogy**:
- Analogies are like bridges that can encompass everything
- Choosing a high level of abstraction may include unwanted elements

#### Analogies in Arguments: Common Misuse and Pitfalls

**Analogies and Logical Arguments**

**How Analogies Can Go Wrong:**
- In an argument, one uses a statement B that is more engaging, accessible or clear cut as an analogy to statement A
- Implicitly, there is a principle X at work
- The claim is: "A is analogous to B. B is true. Therefore A is true."
- This argument has a logical flaw since just because B is true does not mean that principle X is true
- The disagreement lies in the principle X being assumed for A and B
- Those opposed may think allowing same-sex marriage will lead to more extreme examples like incest, bestiality or paedophilia
- Explicitly stating abstract principles behind arguments can reveal potential escalation of examples.

**Argument Hierarchy:**
- Each arrow represents the process of going from a principle to an instance of the principle
- As we get more abstract, increasingly extreme examples get included
- Someone being pro–gay marriage does not necessarily mean they have accepted all lower level principles fully.

**Historical Context:**
- In past arguments, there were disagreements about marriage between white and non-white people which were once considered below the "unrelated man and woman" principle.

#### Understanding Levels of Abstraction in Analogies

**Analogies and Abstract Principles:**

**Problem with Implicit Levels**
- In real life, abstract principles aren't explicitly stated, leading to ambiguity
- People infer different principles based on analogies
- Lack of explicitness can result in misunderstandings

**Minimal Principle as Basis**
- The lowest common multiple or first meeting place is the most reasonable abstract principle
- Disagreements arise when higher level principles are assumed

**Importance of Explicit Abstract Principles**
- In mathematics, explicit principles are crucial for understanding
- Breakdowns in analogies are expected and do not necessarily indicate failure

**Understanding Situations: Equivalence and Differences**
- Exploring different levels of abstraction helps clarify equivalencies and differences between situations.

**Racism Analogy Example:**
- Debate on whether racism by white people against black people is the same as racism by black people against white people
- Disagreement arises from disagreement on abstract principle level

**Multiplication vs Addition:**
- Differences: Multiplication doesn't have an inverse (undoing), while addition does
- Understanding these differences aids in grasping situations more effectively.

### 14 Equivalence

**Mathematics Myths Debunked:**
- **Myth 1**: Mathematics is solely about getting the right answer or simple equations.
- **Reality**: Equations are important, but mathematics goes beyond equations to study more complex objects and their relationships, which involve various senses of "sameness."

**Equations: Finding Sameness in Differences**
- Equations reveal liars among truths (x = x)
- Some truth in other equations, but not complete sameness
- Use the sense of sameness to understand differences

**Analogies and Abstraction Levels**
- Analogies: finding situations that aren't exactly the same but share common qualities
- Pivot from sameness to gain emotional engagement or moral clarity
- Different levels of abstraction yield varying degrees of sameness

**Equivalence in Mathematics: Sense vs. Sensitivity**
- As mathematics evolves, it deals with more complex objects and concepts
- Multiple ways for things to be equivalent or not
- Focus on understanding "In what sense are these the same and in what sense are they different?"

#### Understanding Equivalence and Sameness in Mathematics

**Handwriting and Sameness**
- Humans are accustomed to varying levels of sameness in different situations
- Recognize handwritten "a"s as the same letter but written by different people
- Handwriting fonts on computers lack the subtle variations that indicate human authorship
- Math equivalence: congruent vs. similar triangles
  - Congruent: identical shape and size (same angles, equal side lengths)
  - Similar: same angles but possibly different side lengths
  - Scaled versions of each other
- Equivalence and sameness depend on what is taken into account
  - Strict equalities like x = x are unchanging
  - Advanced math explores subtle differences in higher dimensions.

**The Poincaré Conjecture**
- Famous recently solved mathematical problem
- Involves understanding the concept of "same" in higher-dimensional spaces
  - Overlook size but consider shape, curvature, and pointiness
- Example: A ring doughnut is considered equivalent to a coffee cup with a handle due to the correspondence between their holes.
- Abstract concepts are challenging to visualize in higher dimensions.

#### False Equivalence: A Logical Fallacy

**Poincaré Conjecture and Homotopy Equivalence**
- The Poincaré Conjecture is about which spaces are considered the same under certain conditions (homotopy equivalence)
- A square can be seen as the same as a circle in this sense, but not in practical applications like making a wheel or cake
- In real life, things can have more nuanced ways of being the same and different

**False Equivalence**
- Misunderstanding arises when two statements are equated falsely
- Example: Arguments about gendering of children's clothes and toys
  - Some argue for equal treatment of toys for both genders
  - Others claim it's about turning boys into girls or vice versa (false equivalence)
- False equivalence is a form of logical fallacy that twists someone's position into an extreme
- Rooted in incorrect logic, failing to understand the grey areas between statements.

#### False Equivalences in Perception and Communication

**Divisions from Flawed Analogies:**
- Can occur when someone takes an argument too far to extremes
- Creates divisions instead of finding common ground
- Example: gender stereypes and pressure
- Underlying issues might not be logical, but personal.

**Personal Taste:**
- Expressing personal taste can offend others
- False equivalence occurs when one statement is assumed equivalent to another that it's not logically equivalent with
- Examples: "I don't like toast" vs "I think people who like toast are bad", "I don't want to be fat" vs "I think people who are fat are bad".
- The error is a form of converse error.

**False Equivalence:**
- A : I don’t want to be X.
- B : I think people who are X are bad.
- Implication not very contentious: B ≤ A
- People getting upset assume the converse is true: A ≤ B, causing false equivalence.
- Similar form of false equivalence: "I like doing X every day" vs "I think everyone should do X every day".

#### False Equivalence: Causes of Misunderstandings and Conflict

**False Equivalence and Logic**:
- **Example**: Playing piano vs brushing teeth
  - Personal preference: playing piano (subjective)
  - Universal standard: brushing teeth (objective)
- Human language is not the same as logic
  - Connotations can lead to misunderstandings
- Admit when language causes false equivalence
  - Find alternative ways to express yourself
- Examine own motivations and potential hidden biases

**Damning Accusations from False Equivalence**:
- **Example**: Not wanting to be fat = misogynistic
  - Avoids productive dialogue, creates antagonism
- Signs of false equivalence: "You're basically saying..."
  - Twists words into something they're not
- Complex issues require careful consideration and dialogue.

#### False Dichotomies and Logical Fallacies in Debate

**False Equivalence and Dichotomies:**

**False Equivalence:**
- Antagonistic arguments based on flawed logic
- Often involve a dichotomy (two options perceived as distinct)
- Can include false dichotomies, where options are not cleanly split or both are incorrect

**Example of False Equivalence in an Argument:**
1. Person A argues for reproductive education in schools
2. Person B equates it to condoning sex outside marriage
3. Logic fails due to misinterpretation and false equivalence
4. Counterarguments may be confusing as both sides contain logical fallacies

**False Dichotomy:**
- A type of argument where only two options are perceived
- The options are not cleanly split or both are incorrect
- Can lead to flawed logic and misunderstandings

**Example of False Dichotomy:**
1. Labeling toys as "for boys" or "for girls"
2. Assuming forcing boys to be girls and girls to be boys if labels are removed
3. Fear of grey areas may cause this false dichotomy
4. Neither option A nor B may be true for some individuals

**True Dichotomy:**
- A type of argument where options are cleanly split
- Both options are distinct and mutually exclusive

**False Negation:**
- A type of false dichotomy where both statements appear to be negations of each other
- But, in reality, neither statement is the complete opposite of the other

**Example of False Negation:**
1. "I wouldn't call you skinny" vs "You think I'm fat"
2. Fear of societal pressure causing false dichotomy
3. Both statements may be incorrect or incomplete
4. Possible relationships between the different statements: [Diagram showing the relationships between the different statements involved]

#### False Dichotomies and Straw Man Arguments in Debate

**False Dichotomies and Straw Man Arguments**

**False Dichotomies**:
- Some people should watch what they eat
- Some people should not watch what they eat
- These two statements are compatible, but often lead to false arguments
- Resulting in extremes: "Everyone should watch what they eat" vs. "Nobody should watch what they eat"
- Rooted in the false equivalence that choosing one option means denying others

**Straw Man Arguments**:
- False dichotomies can lead to straw man arguments
- Replacing a valid argument with an easier one to criticize (straw man)
- This invalidates the original argument as it was not equivalent in the first place

**Creativity vs. STEM Education**:
- Criticisms of STEM education sometimes focus on creativity being neglected
- This creates a false dichotomy between:
  - Creativity (being creative)
  - Logic/Scientific thinking (being logical)
- Creativity and logic can coexist in both art and science
- Arguing against STEM education by focusing on creativity is a straw man argument

#### Exposing the Misunderstanding: Debunking the "All Lives Matter" Argument

**Straw Man Arguments**

**Pernicious Straw Man Argument**:
- "All lives matter" as a response to "Black lives matter"
- Misinterprets "Black lives matter" as "Black lives matter and other lives don't"
- Refuted by saying "All lives matter", which is not the original argument

**Straw Man Argument vs. True Argument**:
- Logically, there is no disagreement between "black lives matter" and "all lives matter"
- However, if we replace "black lives matter" with the straw man argument "some lives don't matter", it creates an antagonistic diagram

**Three Parts of the True Argument**:
- A: Black lives matter just as much as other lives
- B: Black lives are currently being treated as if they do not matter as much
- C: We need to do something to correct this injustice

**Refuting the True Argument**:
- Refutes one of the three parts (A, B, or C)
- If A is refuted, the refuter is an out-and-out explicit racist
- If B is refuted, the refuter is ignorant about the state of the world or deluding themselves
- If C is refuted, the refuter might not actively engage in oppression but is complicit with the oppressors

**Understanding the Disagreement**:
- Gain clarity on why the person disagrees with parts B and C
- Is it because they think black people bring it on themselves?
- Or is it because they don't believe it's anyone's responsibility to help others?

#### Overcoming Emotional Barriers in Debates and Using Analogies Effectively

**Impasse in Discussions:**
* Difficulties may arise when someone doesn't believe in helping others (basic difference in axioms)
* Emotionally valid possibility: opposing "Black Lives Matter" due to association with anger and aggression
* Discuss whether these associations are accurate and reasonable
* Identify grey areas where aggression is understandable or not
* Complex arguments require calm, precise statements
* Avoid straw man arguments by expressing positions precisely

**Arguments through Analogies:**
* False equivalences can arise in complex situations
* Not strictly logical but emotional role in persuasion
* Fallacy of false equivalence: A is (falsely) equivalent to B
* Difficulties with making precise, slow arguments in a fast-paced world.

#### The Misuse and Misunderstanding of Mansplaining

**Equivalence in Arguments:**
* A and B may not always be equivalent logically or abstractly
* False equivalence can occur when assuming they are
* Analogies can be used to connect principles, but level of abstraction matters
* Importance of discussing appropriate principle

**Straw Man Argument**:
* A is not necessarily equivalent to B
* Emotional connection made through analogy
* Principle X determines equivalence in certain situations
* False equivalence vs. analogous according to principle X or Y

**Mansplaining:**
* Not a logical equivalence, but an issue of societal assumptions
* Man explains something to woman despite her expertise
* Rebecca Solnit's experience: mansplainer ignored evidence of woman's knowledge.

#### False Equivalence: The Problem of Analogical Inconsistency

**Mansplaining: A Societal Issue**
* The assumption of a woman's ignorance is part of a larger societal pattern of undervaluing or neglecting women's contributions (patronizing).
* Mansplain refers to this specific context and is not something women can do.
* Straw man argument: "women mansplain things too" - false equivalence, as it misrepresents the original argument.

**False Equivalence in Arguments**
* False accusations of false equivalence can shut down valid arguments.
* Higher education vs government funding example:
  * Critics argue that individuals make decisions on how to spend government money for higher education and healthcare.
  * Counterargument: Not all analogies are the same, but consistency in principle should be considered.
    - People don't "decide" to get sick or go to the doctor; they seek care when needed.
    - However, decisions about higher education and healthcare both involve individual choices within the context of government funding.
* The argument isn't about black and white logic systems but rather a fuzzy logic system with various nuances.

#### Understanding False Equivalences and Logical Manipulation in Debates

**False Equivalence and Healthcare vs Education**

**Perception of Necessity**:
- Most people go to college or university because they perceive it as crucial for their future
- Perception is subjective, what looks like an involuntary necessity to one may seem like a voluntary choice to another

**False Equivalence and Dichotomies**:
- Leads to false arguments and fabricated division between people who might not be disagreeing
- Exploited by politicians, media, or individuals with personal gain from discord

**Examples of False Equivalence in Politics**:
- Opposition parties making strong emotional appeals to label certain positions as "unpatriotic"
- Nuanced arguments needed to discuss what exactly is being debated (e.g., love and support for one's country)

**Destructive Consequences of False Equivalence**:
- Homophobic or transphobic individuals perpetuating false equivalences between homosexuality/transgenderism and pedophilia
- Manipulation relies on people's inability to think logically enough to see through it

- Emotions are not false; they reflect genuine feelings
- Understanding emotions is crucial for logical endeavors
- Emotions can help identify beliefs and logical correctness
- Emotions can assist in arriving at logical justifications
- Emotions play a role in persuading others

**Emotions and Logic:**
- False dichotomy between using emotions vs. logic
- Both emotions and logic are necessary
- Being emotional does not equate to being irrational
- Antagonism about intelligence and sympathy is unnecessary

**Emotions in Logical Process:**
1. Use emotions to determine beliefs and logical correctness
2. Use logic for justification when convinced by emotions
3. Use emotions to persuade others, reinforcing the logic
4. Emotions should complement, not contradict, logic
5. Both emotional and logical thinking are possible and necessary in various situations.

#### Balancing Logic and Emotions for Effective Decision-Making

**Logic vs. Emotion**

**The Middle Ground:**
- Crucial middle part of theory development
- Maintain logic while considering emotions
- Coexist and strengthen each other

**Logic (Left Hemisphere):**
- Demands dispassion, focus on factual analysis
- Not for: generating new ideas or dealing with personal emotions
- Essential during proof and understanding for others

**Emotion (Right Hemisphere):**
- Valuable in sensory experiences, art, supporting others
- Difficult to apply logic in emotional states
- Important for dealing with people and understanding complex world interactions

**Childhood Development:**
- Emotional dominance is normal
- Developing ability to comprehend longer chains of causation and logic
- Ability to make long-term plans, sacrifice short term gains for future benefits

**The Outside (Avoid):**
- Neither emotional nor logical

**Emotion vs. Irrationality:**
- Emotion isn't always irrational
- Living emotionally doesn't mean neglecting the logical world.

#### Overriding Logic with Emotions in Communication and Argument

**Emotions vs Logic:**
* **Respect and trust emotions, but seek logical explanations**
* Emotions can override logic: fear and shock are examples
	+ Fear causes people to act without logic in emergency situations
	+ Clickbait headlines often manipulate emotions by misrepresenting articles' content
* In interpersonal arguments, fear can prevent productive dialogue
	+ People may cling to positions out of fear rather than finding common ground
* Importance of using emotions effectively: building bridges between positions instead of creating conflict.

**Persuasive Emotions:**
* Some basic words have strong emotional effects on people
	+ Language shapes how we perceive concepts
* Mathematicians choose words carefully to elicit desired emotional responses when introducing new mathematical concepts.

#### The Power of Language in Emotional Manipulation

**Impact of Words and Naming**

**Effect of Names:**
- Juliet's quote: names can affect perception but not reality
- Confusion from AA boarding procedure change
  - Renamed priority groups caused emotional upset
  - Logically, no difference in order of boarding
  - Emotional impact led to misunderstanding and confusion

**Emotional Connotations:**
- Powerful influence on thoughts and actions
- Manipulation: negative associations but also a tool for positive change
  - Overcoming fears (flying, weight loss)

**Language and Education:**
- Misconceptions about rape in university study
  - Non-consensual intercourse vs. rape
  - Importance of consent education

**Emotional Manipulation:**
- World's constant attempts to manipulate us
- Negative associations but can be used positively for personal growth and understanding emotions.

#### The Logic Behind Emotional Decisions

**Understanding Emotional Manipulation:**
- **Grey areas**: used for manipulation, including self-manipulation to boost motivation or overcome mind blocks (not acceptable for use on others)
- **Emotional tricks**: can be employed to motivate ourselves when logic fails
- **Logical vs emotional thinking**: the author's mother, a logical person, never procrastinates; however, logic cannot enable one to become more logical
- **Feelings as facts**: in a "post-truth" world, emotions are sometimes presented as facts (not necessarily a bad thing)
  - Personal experience: valid source of learning
  - Charismatic teachers: effective educators
  - Peer pressure and tribe mentality: can contribute to positive change
- **Fear-based decisions**: often considered negative; marketing and advertising use emotions to sell products, both good and bad outcomes result
- **Fields that invoke emotions**: religious leaders, public speakers, teachers, advertisers, artists (science sometimes overlooks the importance of emotions)

**Emotions vs Logic:**
- **Feelings are not facts**: emotions should not be mistaken for facts
- **Evidence and logic vs emotions**: it is unrealistic to expect people to be persuaded solely by evidence and logic; scientists are not immune from drawing conclusions based on personal experience or emotions (hypocritical)
- **Acknowledging emotions' truth**: rather than denigrating emotions, we should acknowledge their logic and seek understanding in emotional discourse.

#### Analogies as Emotional Bridge for Logical Understanding

**Feelings as Facts:**
* Feeling something is always true, cannot be argued down by logic (1)
* Emotions powerful enough to override logic
* Productive process: uncover explanation behind emotions and bridge the gap between different thought processes

**Fear and Political Views:**
* Fear doesn't explain all political views fully
* Better analogy: personal beliefs around sacrifices (2)
* Climate change: taking action requires personal sacrifices, fear not always a factor
* Gun control: giving up resources for refugees instead of being afraid of them

**The Power of Analogies:**
* Abstract situations with common elements (3)
* Engage emotions and make people feel things differently about a situation
* Logic might be understood once emotions are changed through an analogy.

#### Comparing Prejudice: Power Dynamics and Analogies

**Using Analogies for Emotional Connection**

**Pivot from Logic to Emotions:**
- Use analogies to engage someone emotionally
- Move from a situation they don't react strongly to, to one with strong emotional reactions

**Example: Prejudice Across Power Relationships:**
- Men have power over women in society
- Some argue that this doesn't matter because "it's the same"
- But it is not equivalent when considering power differentials

**Equivalence vs. Relevance:**
- Equivalent: People mistreating other people
- Relevant: People with power mistreating those without power

**Power Differential in Teacher-Pupil Relationships:**
- Example of clear-cut power difference
- Legal issue in some countries
- Even if consensual, still considered unethical or inappropriate due to the power dynamic.

#### Understanding Emotional Axioms in Disagreements

**Power Differentials and Analogies**

**Power Differences**:
- Teacher making advances on pupil is different from pupil making advances on teacher due to power differentials
- Boss trying to seduce employee is different from employee trying to seduce boss due to power the boss has over the employee

**Arguments about Power Differentials**:
- Agreeing that power differentials make a difference in clear-cut cases
- Disagreeing on grey areas and where to draw the line
- Possible transfer of group power (white people over black people) to individuals, the question of structural racism

**Tensions between Individuals and Groups**:
- Arguments come down to tensions between individual vs group responsibility
- Extent to which people think a group's treatment by society bears on an individual's
- Difference in basic personal axioms

**Uncovering Personal Axioms**:
- Using analogies to uncover one's own personal axioms
- Understanding why someone thinks the way they do (not just disagreements in logic)
- Changing deeply rooted principles through experience, meeting people, education, empathy, and engaging emotionally

**Emotions and Intuition**:
- Emotions and intuition are convincing, even if not backed by logic
- Use of intuition has achieved a lot in mathematics
- Importance of invoking emotional means to convey logical thoughts

### 16 Intelligence and rationality

**Logical Behavior: The Blend of Logic and Emotions**

**Logical Human:**
- Uses logic as much as possible
- Has core beliefs not justified
- Believes everything logically derived from core beliefs
- Avoids contradictions in beliefs

**Illogical vs Rational:**
- "You're being illogical" is used to shut down arguments
- Misconception that logic cannot coexist with emotions

**Reasonable Human:**
- Logic as foundation for intelligence
- Emotions and logic are not mutually exclusive

**Logical vs Intelligent:**
- Being logical: following basic rules of logic
- Being intelligently logical: using advanced techniques, seeking to help others, blend of emotions and logic

**Core Beliefs:**
- Starting point for logical reasoning
- Necessary but not fully justifiable

**Deductive Closure:**
- Believing in everything logically derived from core beliefs

**Consistency:**
- Avoiding contradictions in beliefs

**Limitations of Logic:**
- Doesn't work in isolation
- Not infallible or complete solution to human situations.

#### Debating Logical Consistency: Personal Beliefs and Contradictions

**Logical Disagreements:**
* Two people can disagree while both being logical based on their unique belief systems
* Contradictions within one's own system are considered illogical
* Valid ways a person can be considered illogical:
	1. Beliefs cause contradictions
	2. Beliefs contain inconsistencies that cannot be deduced from fundamental beliefs
	3. Beliefs have logical implications that are not acknowledged or accepted
* Examples:
	+ ACA vs Obamacare disagreement (contradiction)
	+ Feelings about relationships, evolution, vaccines (inconsistencies)
	+ Health insurance coverage for men and women (logical inconsistency)

**Logic vs Illogical:**
* Contradicting someone else's logic does not make you illogical
* Someone's logic may appear irrational in another person's belief system.

#### Understanding Reasonableness: Differences in Fundamental Beliefs

**Understanding Reasonableness in Beliefs:**

**Grey Areas of Fundamental Beliefs:**
- Questionable axioms:
  * Belief in moon landings not happening (unjustified) vs. belief being fundamental
  * Marriage being between man and woman (constructed belief) vs. axiom
  * Voting for someone truly believed in (axiom) vs. justification required
- Distinction between illogical and unreasonable:
  * Unreasonable beliefs may not contradict logic, but are disagreements based on fundamental differences
  * Reasonableness is subjective and culturally dependent
- Understanding grey areas in a nuanced way:
  * Following the logic can lead to undesirable extremes (example: eating any amount of cake)

**Reasonable Human:**
- Judging unreasonable beliefs based on fundamental disagreements
- Acknowledging that reasonableness is a grey area and an unavoidably sociological concept
- Recognizing the importance of having some sort of framework for verification and adjustment in beliefs.

#### The Reasonable Person's Beliefs and Changing Minds

**Framework for Thinking**
- **Logical argument**: Cheese comes from milk, which comes from animals; how did all that milk product get into orbit?
- **Evidence-based argument**: People have been to the moon and brought back dust, not cheese.
- Some people believe moon landings were fake and part of a conspiracy; this is not reasonable because I believe in scientific evidence as a core belief.
- **Personal taste**: Liking or disliking food, music - can sometimes be justified further.

**Reasonableness of Core Beliefs**
- Hard to define objectively without relativism: one person's unreasonable may be another's reasonable.
- Criterion for reasonableness: Are your beliefs open to being reasoned with? Can you change them? Do you have a framework for knowing when to change them? Are there circumstances under which you would change them?

**Macduff's Approach**
- Tried to persuade Malcolm to return and fight Macbeth.
- Portrayed himself as a terrible person, describing what a cruel and evil king he would be if made king.
- Needed to see whether Malcolm's support was rational or not.
- If the support was rational, he would withdraw it upon hearing Malcolm's admissions.
- If the support did not withdraw, he concluded it was not rational and untrustworthy.
- In this case, Macduff withdrew his support upon realizing Malcolm was unsuitable to be king.

#### Changing One's Mind: A Rational Approach

**Openness to Changing One's Conclusions or Axioms:**
* Sign of rationality: accepting evidence over loyalty
* Loyalty vs blind support
	+ Minor issues: no change in support
	+ Major issues: changing axioms (logic, evidence, emotions)
* Examples: compulsory voting, liberal arts education, feminism, getting up early, self-care

**Frameworks:**
* Maths and science: logical proof or evidence-based theory
	+ Rigorous validation processes
* News reporting: gathering information for accountability
	+ Standards of cross-checking and reliability of sources
* Difference between erroneous reporting and "fake news"
	+ Erroneous: retractable due to framework for verification
	+ Fake news: no framework or procedure for verification.

#### The Dangers of Extreme Skepticism and Unquestioning Loyalty

**Maintaining Distinctions between Statements**
- Importance of distinguishing statements made within a framework from those without
- Difficulty defining fact versus falsehood: facts are verified within well-described frameworks, but frameworks can change
- Risk of getting caught in a loop with the notion of "reasonable" frameworks
  - Danger of cyclic definitions
  - People can disagree about what is reasonable due to differing frameworks

**Scepticism and Loyalty**
- Both scepticism and loyalty important, but dangerous when taken to extremes
- Blind scepticism and blind loyalty: unwillingness to change one's mind under any conditions
  - Climate change denier example: refusing to believe in global warming unless average temperature rises by 10°C in one year
    - Unrealistic condition, akin to "believing if hell freezes over"
  - Deniers of evolution unlikely to change their minds despite evidence
- Scientists should try using emotions instead of evidence to persuade deniers
- Blind loyalty: unconditional support for a person regardless of their actions
  - Dangerous when it leads to cult status and hero worship
  - Parental love an example, but can be pushed beyond limits with mass murderer child
  - Less extreme cases seen in people who exploit power.

#### Balancing Scepticism and Trust in the Gray Areas of Reasonableness

**Unconditional Support and Behavioral Issues:**
- Unconditional support from followers can lead to misbehavior (genius complex)
- Contributes to cultures of exploitation and harassment
- Difficulty determining when to withdraw support: grey area of reasonableness

**Grey Areas in Reasonableness:**
- Many things exist between black and white, including trust and scepticism
- Healthy vs. blind forms of both trust and scepticism
- Framework for justifying beliefs important: science as an example

**Science and Expertise:**
- Avoid extremes in regard to trust or skepticism towards scientific experts
- Healthy trust based on evidence, logic, self-reflective process
- Blind trust or skepticism lacking justification and framework.

#### "Powerful Rationality: Abstraction, Chain of Logic, and Compound Ideas"

**Powerful Rationality:**
- Being rational is a start but not enough for true insight (1)
  - Avoiding illogic not same as going somewhere intellectually (2)
  - Powerful rationality: using logic to build complex arguments and gain new insights (3)
- Three components of powerful rationality (4)
  1. Long chains of deduction: following logic forwards and backwards
     * Forwards: comprehending consequences of thinking
     * Backwards: constructing complex justifications
     * Able to axiomatize beliefs down to fundamental level
        - Not taking things as fundamental belief (5)
  2. Building interrelated ideas into compound units (6)
     * Grouping things as one unit: family, team, company
     * Singular verbs used with compound nouns
  3. Abstraction: separating relevant details from irrelevant ones (7)
     * Finding principles behind situations
     * Following long chains of logic backwards and forwards.

#### Bridging Divides: A Call for Intelligently Rational Dialogue

**Powerful Rationality**

**Understanding Complex Systems:**
- "My family is going out for dinner" instead of "my family are going out for dinner"
- Comprehending individuals within systems
- Develop logical power to understand complex relationships
- Overcoming complexity by viewing as single unit
- Gray areas: range of probabilities instead of simplistic answers
- Ignoring other causes or packaging whole system as one cause
- Facility at moving between abstraction levels and contexts

**Separating Axioms from Implications:**
- Understanding role of logic and emotions
- Finding logical justifications for emotional facts
- Intelligently rational: using power to help the world
- Bridging divides, fostering nuanced dialogue
- Working towards a connected whole.

#### Emotional Intelligence in Decision-Making and Conflict Resolution

**Intelligent Rationality: Collaboration over Competition**

**The Essence of Humanity**:
- People collaborate for the greater good, rather than compete
- This is the essence of teamwork and communities

**Cipolla's Theory of Intelligence**:
- Stupidity: Benefiting yourself but harming others (bandit)
- Unfortunate: Benefitting others but hurting yourself (martyr)
- Zero-sum game: Hurt yourself and others at the same time (prisoner's dilemma)
- Intelligent Rationality: Helping yourself and others at the same time

**Defining Intelligence**:
- Not based on knowledge, achievements, or qualifications
- Helping everyone through logical arguments and emotions

**Intelligent Rationality in Action**:
- Using logic to defeat someone's argument is the intellectual version of being a bandit
- Intelligent rationality involves understanding the logic behind someone else's emotional response
- Emotionally swamped by minor details can lead to dissonance between reason and emotion.

#### Finding Common Ground: Good Arguments for Logical Disagreements

**Understanding Disagreements:**

**Reducing Fear through Self-Awareness**
- Identify source of fear
- Make conscious decision based on long-term vs short-term priorities

**Logical People Can Still Disagree**

**Logical People Can Still Disagree (continued)**
- Acknowledge different starting points (axioms)
- Not necessarily illogical or stupid
- Scope of logic has limitations
- Agree on fundamental principles, not just logical proofs.

**Good Arguments: Long Chains of Logic and Expressing in Fundamental Principles**
- Follow long chains of logic in both arguments
- Root cause: close to a fundamental principle
- Use analogies for investigation
  - Helps understand complex ideas
- Generalize principles for further analysis.

**Good Arguments: Dealing with Apparent Paradoxes**
- Address discrepancies between logical situation and intuition
- Logical proofs + good exposition (emotional component)
- Understanding the underlying principles can help resolve apparent paradoxes.

#### Building Empathetic Connections Through Logic & Emotion

**Building Bridges Through Understanding**

**Finding Common Ground:**
- Use abstraction and pivots to understand different positions
- Engage emotions for connection
- Find what persuades others to change their minds
- Show own openness to moving position

**Avoiding Competition in Arguments:**
- Discussions don't have to be competitions
- Understanding, not defeating, should be the main aim
- Avoid attack and defence cycles

**Creating Connections through Logic and Emotions:**
- Good arguments invoke emotions for connection
- Logic takes time, so engage in slow arguments
- Build bridges to people who disagree

**Persuading Reluctant Individuals:**
