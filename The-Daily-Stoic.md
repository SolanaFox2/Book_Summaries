- Serenity and stability come from internal control, not external circumstances

#### Overcoming Rote Behavior: Cultivating Mindfulness and Creativity

**MUSONIUS Rufus on Seeking Wisdom**
- **The person in training**: urged to rise above seeking pleasure and pain, clinging to life or abhorring death, valuing receiving over giving
- The worker's response "Because that's the way we've always done things" is frustrating and sets the business for disruption
- We should apply ruthlessness to our own habits, questioning if we are doing things the best way and for the right reasons

**Reboot the Real Work**
- Fear of failure can prevent us from trying new things as teenagers
- The stakes are higher in adulthood, but we have the guidance of wise philosophers through their teachings

#### "Embrace Clarity and Choice: Ancient Stoic Wisdom for Modern Challenges"

**Marcus Aurelius' Perspective on Life**

**The Power of Oratory and Art**:
- Fronto, considered Rome's best orator besides Cicero, was chosen by Marcus' adopted father to teach him:
  - How to think, write, and speak
  - Provided a "powerful perspective" on ordinary or seemingly unbeautiful events
- It takes an artist's eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit falling from its tree
- It takes a poet to notice the way "baking bread splits in places and those cracks, while not intended in the baker's art, catch our eye and serve to stir our appetite"

**Freedom of Choice**:
- The Stoics had vastly different stations in life
  - Some were rich, some were born at the bottom of Rome's rigid hierarchy
  - Some had it easy, others had it unimaginably hard
- We all come to philosophy from different backgrounds and experience bouts of good fortune and bad fortune
- The key is to focus on what is in our control as opposed to what is not
  - Regardless of our station, "what matters is our choices"

**Reigniting Your Thoughts**:
- **Marcus Aurelius**: "Your principles can't be extinguished unless you snuff out the thoughts that feed them"
- If we've been drifting away from our principles and beliefs, we can "restart living again" and "see things anew as you once did"

#### Morning Reflection and Daily Review for Personal Growth

**Morning Ritual and Reflection:**
* Successful people practice morning rituals for reflection (meditation, exercise, journaling)

**Seneca's Letter to Novatus:**
* Seneca practiced daily review of actions and thoughts
* Asked himself tough questions: what bad habit did I curb today? How am I better? Were my actions just? How can I improve?
* Journaling as a form of practice, tracking progress.

#### The True Nature of Wealth and Understanding

**The Truth About Money**
- **F. Scott Fitzgerald**: "Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me."

- **Seneca's Perspective**: 
    - Rich and poor often appear similar in certain situations (e.g., travel, military service)

**The Importance of Self-Respect**:
- Education and teaching are about recognizing the value of one's own mind
- Prioritizing self-respect leads to freedom, self-sufficiency, and liberation from passion
- Lack of self-respect leads to envy, jealousy, and suspicion towards those with power

**Examples of Wealthy Individuals**:
- Warren Buffett, John Urschel, Kawhi Leonard: Live modestly despite financial wealth

- This allows them to pursue what truly matters in life and find happiness

**The Power of a Mantra**:
- **Mantra**: Sacred utterance or thought intended to provide clarity and spiritual guidance
- Marcus Aurelius suggests a Stoic mantra for dealing with false impressions, distractions, and the crush of everyday life

- Just as media pros remain composed, we too need to manage our impulses
- Reason and philosophy are filters for good versus bad impulses
- Stoic thought emphasizes controlling impulses through reasoned choice (prohairesis)
- Comparison to managing a disordered person in life: think before you act.

#### Embracing Peace: Navigating Fear and Avoiding Self-Fulfilling Prophecies

**Principles Guiding Action vs. Inaction**

**Don't Seek Out Strife**:
- Wise person chooses peace over war
- Theodore Roosevelt's "Man in the Arena" speech: lionizes those who strive valiantly, but also those who choose to be at peace

**Fear and Self-Destruction**:
- Fear can lead to self-fulfilling prophecy
- Paranoid leaders may destroy themselves more quickly than their enemies
- Leaders' fear can manifest as micromanagement, mismanagement, or other negative outcomes

#### Overcoming Anger: Cultivating Emotional Mastery

**Stoic Perspectives on Emotions and Anger:**

**The Power of Relief Through Action**
- Seneca's question: "I hope this is making you feel better." (Moral Letters, 78.17)
- Emotion can't justify behavior or relieve symptoms
- Ask yourself if expressing emotion truly improves situation

**The Power of No Opinion**
- Marcus Aurelius: "We have the power to hold no opinion about a thing" (Meditations, 6.52)
- Cultivating ability to remain unaffected by negative things
- Practice indifference for lessened impact

**Anger as Bad Fuel**
- Seneca on Anger: "There is no more stupefying thing than anger" (On Anger, 3.1.5)
- Anger seldom solves problems
- Creates unnecessary conflict and negative side effects
- May lead to self-anger and increased requirement for fuel

**The Stoic Perspective:**
- Emotions are transient experiences that have minimal effect on our true selves if we choose not to engage with them.
- Cultivating a mindset of indifference towards negative external factors can help reduce their power over us.
- Anger is an unproductive emotion as it rarely solves problems but instead creates more conflict and negative consequences.

#### Navigating Emotions: Stoicism for Stress Management

**Seneca on Tyranny and Kingship**
- **Hate and Anger**: Too burdensome to bear; toxic fuel (King Jr.)
- Power doesn't necessarily corrupt, but individual values and self-awareness matter (Epictetus)
  - Examples: Nero vs. Hadrian
  - Personal and professional life: Choose to be a "hero" or "tyrant"

**Protecting Peace of Mind**
- **Perception**: Guard it carefully (Epictetus)
- Stoicism can help manage difficult situations, but is it worth the cost?
  - Adrenal glands have limits
- Consider making a change if constant upsets aren't the life you want

**Pleasure and Punishment**
- **Impressions of pleasure**: Don't get carried away; consider past regrets (Epictetus)

#### Cultivating Self-Control and Mindfulness

**Self-Control and Temptation**

**Epictetus' Advice**:
- Compare the satisfaction of abstaining to that of giving into temptation
- Don't be overwhelmed by the comfort, pleasantness, and allure - consider how much better it is to conquer the temptation

**Cheat Days**:
- Dieting method where you have one "cheat day" per week to eat whatever you want
- Eating yourself sick on cheat days leads to regret and eventual abstinence from cheating

**Connecting Temptation with Consequences**:
- Understanding the negative effects of indulging makes the urge lose its appeal
- Self-control becomes the true pleasure, not the act of indulgence

**Thinking Before You Act**:
- Use your intelligence and reason to guide your actions, not just emotions and immediate sensations

**False Woes**:
- Many of our worries are "bad dreams" that never materialize in reality
- Vividly imagining worst-case scenarios can be unfounded and counterproductive

#### Navigating Emotional Challenges: Epictetus' Wisdom on Handling Conflict and Seeking Contentment

**Waking Up from Extreme Emotions:**
* Getting upset is like continuing a dream while awake (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 6.26)
* Reactions have real consequences
* Don't make things harder than they need to be
* Focus on individual acts and completing tasks

**The Enemy of Happiness:**
* Conditional happiness: always looking forward to something as a source of contentment (Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24.17)
* Anticipating future events or desiring more can hinder current happiness
* Choose between yearning for "more" and true happiness

**Preparing for the Storm:**
* The struggle to gain mastery, freedom, and tranquility is like preparing for a storm (Epictetus, Discourses, 2.18.27-28)
* Remain firm in the face of impressions and don't let them "kidnap" you.

#### The Art of Patience: Navigating Desire and Pleasure in Life

**Epictetus' Metaphor of Life's Banquet:**
* Remember to conduct yourself at life's "banquet" as an attendee:
  + Take a moderate helping when something desirable comes your way
  + Don't reach across the table and take it without permission
  + Wait patiently if it hasn't arrived yet
* Metaphor has other interpretations:
  + Gratitude for being invited to this wonderful feast of life experiences
  + Savoring and enjoying the present moment
  + Selflessness in helping others, as we have been helped
  + Charity towards others when it is our turn to host
* Warning against indulging every whim:
  + Consider the consequences for those who dedicate their lives to material possessions or vices (e.g., robbers, perverts, killers, and tyrants)
  + Ask whether the pursuit of pleasure is truly worth it
  + Wishing not leads to wanting not; avoiding cravings and vices can help us grow as individuals.

#### Mindfulness and Self-Control in Ancient Philosophy

**Epictetus' Perspective on Desire:**
- External values can subjugate us if we place too much importance on them (Pictetus, Discourses 4.4.1–2; 15)
- Desire leads to vulnerability and potential disappointment (ibid.)
- Diogenes: "It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of godlike men to want little" (Diogenes, Cynic quote)
- Wanting nothing makes one invincible as it's beyond our control (ibid.)
- Desires can wreck us, even if they seem noble (Gatsby example)
- Ask yourself if you are in control of your goals or they are in control of you.

**Cato the Younger:**
- Practiced public speech but didn't rehearse it in front of others (Plutarch, Cato 4)
- Believed proper philosophy requires maintaining a "warlike element" (ibid.)
- Waited and prepared before speaking, ensuring his words were worthy (ibid.)
- Avoided pandering to the mob or acting impulsively (ibid.)
- Awareness is necessary for self-evaluation (ibid.)

**Marcus Aurelius:**
- Quotes from other writers in his Meditations (Meditations 7.38)
- Not necessarily original work but a practice of reminding himself of important lessons (ibid.)
- "You shouldn't give circumstances the power to rouse anger, for they don't care at all" (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 7.38).

**The Real Source of Harm**
- Harm comes from our own beliefs, opinions, and reactions
- Objectively good or bad occurrences don't exist
- Reactions depend on context and categorization
- Retain control over labeling situations as good or bad
- Choosing not to react can help manage harm

**The Smoke and Dust of Myth (Marcus Aurelius)**

- When water appears troubled, it's not the light that moves but the spirit within (Discourses, 3.3.20-22)
- When a person loses composure, their virtues and skills are unaffected; only their spirit is disturbed
- Regain composure to regain access to these skills and virtues

**Philosophy and Prioritization**
- Modern lives focus on having it all at once (work, family, purpose, etc.)
- Ancient Greece's lecture hall (scholeion) was a leisure center for contemplating higher things (good, true, beautiful)
- Training the mind to prioritize and question desires: Do I need this thing? What will happen if I don't get it? Can I make do without it?

**Beginning Philosophy**
- Start with clear self-perception and questioning emotions, beliefs, language (Discourses, 1.26.15)
- Self-awareness is the foundation of philosophy; recognizing the ability to analyze one's own mind

**Accurate Self-Assessment**
- Necessary for a person to have a true self-estimate (On Tranquility of Mind, 5.2)
- Resistance to self-assessment stems from fear of admitting weaknesses but essential for growth and understanding.

#### Navigating Internal Conflict: Seeking Inner Integration and Freedom

**Goethe's Maxim:**
- Valuing yourself at less than your true worth is as damaging as overestimating your abilities
- Importance of self-awareness and internal integration to avoid external disintegration

**Complexity of Human Beings:**
- We have multiple sides: conflicting wants, desires, and fears
- Outside world is confusing and contradictory
- Risk of tearning apart if focus on internal integration is neglected

**Awareness as Freedom:**
- Living as we wish without compulsion or hindrance leads to freedom
- Sad reality: many people spend time on unnecessary obligations and impressions
- Self-imposed slavery: being a slave to money, positions, or desires
- Examples of codependency, micromanagement, and attending obligations out of vanity or ignorance.

#### Cultivating Self-Awareness and Mindfulness

**Take an Inventory of Your Obligations:**
* Evaluate self-imposed vs necessary obligations
* Consider hidden costs of accumulating possessions
* Ask: Do I need this? Is it superfluous? What's the real worth? What am I paying for?
* Be aware of narrative fallacy and its misleading nature
* Avoid dominating conversations with stories about past accomplishments or exaggerated tales
* Question your instincts, patterns, and assumptions (self-awareness)
* Don't trust senses as they can deceive us.

**Self-Awareness:**
* Objectively evaluate the self
* Question own instincts, patterns, and assumptions
* Hold opinions up to hard scrutiny
* Consider that our senses are often wrong or misleading
* Understand that self-deception exists and can be harmful.

**Communication:**
* Avoid dominating conversations with personal stories
* Listen and connect with people instead of performing for them
* Be mindful of narrative fallacy and its potential to create false sense of cohesion and certainty.

#### Maintaining Mental Freedom and Choosing Influential Peers

**Mindful Awareness and Protecting One's Mind**

**Don't Unintentionally Hand Over Your Freedom**
- We protect physical selves but neglect mind's protection
- Hand over mind to external influences: social media, TV, others' actions/thoughts
- Result in distraction, inefficiency, and loss of control
- Stoics emphasize importance of protecting mind
  - Most prized possession
  - Maintain control over perceptions

**Find the Right Scene**
- Surround yourself with people who inspire growth
- Avoid those who drag you down
- Consider impact of people on your life
  - Do they encourage or hinder progress?
- Spend more time with uplifting individuals, less with hindrances.

#### Living as a Free Individual: Lessons from Stoicism

**Goethe's Quote:**
- "If I know how you spend your time, then I know what might become of you." (Goethe)
- The stakes of our choices are significant and can shape who we become.

**The Concept of a Cato or Indifferent Spectator:**
- Seneca encouraged having a respected figure to guide actions, even when they're not physically present.
  - This concept is similar to Adam Smith's "indifferent spectator."
  - A person who can provide quiet admonishment for selfish, dishonest, or lazy behavior.
  - We should strive to be someone else's Cato/Indifferent Spectator as well.

**Living Without Restriction:**
- Epictetus stated that true freedom comes from within and not being subjected to external coercion or restrictions.
- Many successful people trade their freedom for material possessions, social demands, and unable to express their true thoughts.

**Seeing Things as the Person at Fault Does:**
- When someone has wronged us, understanding their perspective can foster compassion instead of anger or astonishment.
- We may share similar notions of good and evil, allowing for an allowance in their actions.
- People generally believe they are right, even when they're wrong.

#### Understanding Perspective and Overcoming Self-Deception

**Perspective on Suffering**
- Some suffering may not be intentional: others may believe they're doing the right thing (Confederate soldiers memorial)
- Focusing on our own plan vs. a bigger plan (Epictetus)
  - Disasters can turn into lucky breaks with time
  - Our loss might be someone else's gain

**Self-Deception as an Obstacle**
- Self-deception and ego hinder learning and growth
- Epictetus: "It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already know"
- To improve or earn respect, we must confront ego and self-deception

**The Present Moment**
- The present moment is all we possess (Diogenes Laertius)
  - No one lives longer than the life they are living in the present moment.

#### Embracing the Power of Personal Choice in Ancient Wisdom

**Present Moment Awareness**
* Neglecting present moment by desiring past or future: ungrateful (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 2.14)
	+ Past: wanting it to be different or better
	+ Future: expecting exactly as we assume
* Present moment is a gift (Today is a gift)
	+ Importance of living in the present
	+ Limited time in possession
	+ Enjoying all of it can last a lifetime

	+ Blessed with the capacity to use logic and reason
	+ Unthinkable power to alter circumstances
	+ Responsibility comes with power
* The beauty of choice (Epictetus, Discourse 3.1.39b – 40a)
	+ You are not your body or possessions, but your capacity for choosing well
	+ Confusing image we present to the world with who we truly are
	+ Admirable: body built from hard work vs. body built to impress gym rats

**Impossibility of Frustration and Overwhelm**
* In tough times, it's impossible for others or objects to frustrate or overwhelm you (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, 9.13)
	+ External objects have no access to your mind
	+ Understanding this: throwing out assumptions that cause frustration and overwhelm.

**Understanding Others (Marcus Aurelius)**
- Prepare for others acting selfishly or ignorantly (Chamfort joke)
  * Swallow the "toad" of understanding upfront
  * Fortified against other unpleasant experiences
  * Not writing off people, but preparing for their potential actions

**Expecting Change in Opinions and Preconceptions (Epictetus)**
- Arrogant opinion and mistrust are liabilities
  * Assumptions can lead to misjudgment
  - Fight biases and preconceptions
    * Ask: What haven't I considered? Why is this the way it is? Am I part of the problem or solution? Could I be wrong here?
- Honoring what we don't know and setting it against our limited knowledge
- Core teaching: We are not as smart and wise as we think we are; wisdom comes from questioning and humility, not certainty or arrogance.

**The Cost of Accepting Counterfeits (Epictetus)**
- When it comes to money, people are vigilant about the authenticity of their investments
  * Similarly, we should apply similar care in assessing our own principles and values
- The term "dokimazein" means "to assay" or check quality
  * Just as ancient people tested coins carefully, we should be diligent in examining our own beliefs and actions.

#### Testing Assumptions and Judgments in Decision Making (Stoicism)

**The Reality of Impressions and Judgments**

**Merchants' Testing of Currency**:
- Skilled merchants could test coinage by throwing it against a hard surface to hear the sound
- Today, we still take measures to confirm the authenticity of money (e.g., rubbing or holding up bills)
- This is for an "imaginary currency," an invention of society

**Caution Against Unquestioned Beliefs**:
- We often accept potentially life-changing thoughts and assumptions without question
- Ironically, we put more effort into ensuring the "reality" of money than our beliefs
- Epictetus advises to "test and separate appearances" and only act on tested ideas

**Trusting Your Senses**:

- Stoicism cultivates the awareness to step back and analyze the accuracy of our senses

**Judgments Cause Disturbance**:
- It is not events themselves that disturb us, but our judgments about them
- The "perceiving eye" sees what things supposedly mean, causing us the most anguish

#### Embrace Humility for Self-Improvement: Lessons from Epictetus

**Epictetus's Teachings: Humility and Learning**

**Rejecting Tantalizing Gifts or Opportunities**
* **Understanding the cost of temptation**: The quote from Seneca's Thyestes play highlights how attractive offers can lead us into trouble (Thyestes, 536). General William T. Sherman is another example of someone who refused an offer that could have potentially harmed his legacy.
* **Caution towards new opportunities**: Not every opportunity is dangerous, but it's important to consider the potential consequences before accepting them.

**Less Is More: Simple Living and Speaking**
* **Avoiding excessive actions and words**: Be careful not to act grudgingly, selfishly, without due diligence, or as a contrarian (Quote from unspecified source). Also, avoid overdressing your thought in fine language. Instead, be cheerful and authentic.

**The Concept of Inner Citadel (Stoicism)**
- A fortress that protects our soul
- Impenetrable inner domain
- Vulnerability is physical, but inner domain is inviolable
- Quote from Epictetus: "No, it is events that give rise to fear—when another has power over them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to inspire fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but by judgments..." (Discourses 4.1.85–87)

**Maintaining the Fortress**
- Our thoughts and actions can betray it
- Fear, greed, avarice can lead to its downfall
- Quote from Marcus Aurelius: "stuff cannot touch the soul" (Meditations 9.40.(6))

**A Different Way to Pray**
- Praying is asking for things in life
- We often seek intervention to make our lives easier
- Suggested prayer: ask for fortitude, strength, and clarity on what we can control
- Quote from Marcus Aurelius: "Try praying differently, and see what happens: Instead of asking for ‘a way to sleep with her,’ try asking for ‘a way to stop desiring to sleep with her.’ Instead of ‘a way to get rid of him,’ try asking for ‘a way to not crave his demise.’ Instead of ‘a way to not lose my child,’ try asking for ‘a way to not fear it.’" (Meditations 9.40.(6))

**A Garden is Not for Show (Reflections on Stoicism)**
- Keep philosophy private and practice constantly
- Quote from Epictetus: "First practice not letting people know who you are—keep your philosophy to yourself for a bit. In just the manner that fruit is produced—the seed buried for a season, hidden, growing gradually so it may come to full maturity..." (Discourses 4.8.35-37)
- Warning: premature display of philosophy might lead to downfall. Quote from Epictetus: "But if the grain sprouts before the stalk is fully developed, it will never ripen." (Discourses 4.8.35-37)

#### Life Lessons on Perseverance, Hatred, and Pain from Stoicism

**The Value of Perseverance vs. Luck**
* Success can come to the undeserving: born lucky or through ease (no skill required)
* Envy may arise from those who want an easy life
* Admirable is one who perseveres despite difficulties and overcomes self-control issues
* Greatness lies in resilience, fortitude, and triumphing against adversity

**Dealing with Haters**
* Opinions of others often reflect more about them than the object of hatred
* Prejudiced individuals may harbor secret attractions to those they hate
* Stoics ask if the opinion is within their control and respond accordingly:
  - If influence is possible, take it
  - If not, accept the hater as they are and focus on one's own actions.

**Embracing Pain**
* Pain is natural and should not be a source of shame or degradation
* Remember that pain has limits: it is never unbearable or endless
* Use Epicurus' saying to keep perspective and avoid adding to the imagined suffering.

#### Life Lessons from Marcus Aurelius: Adaptability and Resilience

**The Power of Flexibility and Adaptability**

- Churchill believed "Nature is merciful" and that "all will be well"

**The Importance of Flexibility**:
- As conditions change and new facts arise, it's important to adapt rather than remain rigid
- Having an "adaptable will" that uses reason to clarify perception, impulse, and judgment is more effective than an "iron will"
- Flexibility combined with strength allows us to be resilient and unstoppable

  - Soldiers build steady patterns of unconscious behaviors through training

**The Unexpected Disaster**

**The Vulnerability of Dependence**
- Recognize that we are all addicts in various ways: routines, comforts, or approvals from others

  * Focus on developing a strong character and confidence instead of hoping for good fortune
- **Building blocks of character**: Each action and thought contributes to the formation of indestructible character
- **Control over external appearances**: Epictetus' perspective (Discourses, 1.1.7–8)
  * We don't control external events, but we control how we interpret them
  * Retaining ability to decide personal meaning gives us ultimate power and fairness
- **Actual needs are small**: Nothing can satisfy greed, a small measure satisfies nature (implied)

**Miscellaneous:**
- **Prosperity's revelation**: Prosperity reveals our true character (Seneca, Moral Letters)

#### Stoic Perspectives on Interdependence and Mutual Aid

**Seneca's Assets: The Most Valuable Investment**
- **Investing in oneself as a wise and good person**: most immune to market fluctuations and disasters
- Example of Seneca: offered Nero money in exchange for freedom, but ultimately relied on virtue and inner strength in his final moments
- Other investments: money, relationships, accomplishments

**Interconnectedness and Mutual Interdependence**
- Concept of **sympatheia**: interconnected cosmos where everything is part of a larger whole
- Importance of remembering our relationship to fellow human beings and the environment
- Opposite of cruelty and senseless harm (e.g., slavery, conquests)

**Stoic Reminders: All for One, One for All**
- Quote from Marcus Aurelius: "That which isn't good for the hive, isn't good for the bee."
- Stoics emphasized interconnectedness and mutual interdependence in a harsh world (Greece/Rome)
- Remembering our role in this world and working together as a team.

**The Consequences of Doing Wrong:**
- Actions have consequences: doing wrong may lead to feelings of guilt or discomfort (Marcus Aurelius, Meditations)
- Consider how you feel about yourself before engaging in unethical behaviors. Is the short-term gain worth the long-term cost?

#### Finding Peace through Virtue and Integrity

**Self-Awareness and Wrongdoing:**
* Self-awareness can serve as a powerful disincentive to doing wrong
* Pleasure is momentary and leaves us wanting more, while wisdom, good character, sobriety, and kindness last longer

**Setting Standards and Using Them:**
* Examine and uphold personal standards in all actions
* Consider if a particular action aligns with deeply held beliefs and values
* Setting standards is essential for living an impeccable life, leading to tranquility

**Reverence and Justice as Guiding Principles:**

**Honesty as Our Default:**
* Authenticity and sincerity should be the foundation of our actions and words
* Avoid disingenuous statements like "giving it to you straight"
* Embrace honesty as a guiding principle for living an authentic life.

#### The Power of Love and Forgiveness in Personal and Public Life

**Honesty and Love:**
- Marcus Aurelius: "be like a smelly goat - others will know" (Meditations, 11.15)
- Empty expressions of honesty may indicate lack thereof
- Cultivate reputation based on unquestionable honesty and directness
- Honesty is as permanent as a tattoo, saving need for reassurances

**Love:**
- Barbara Jordan: called for love in personal and public life at Democratic National Convention (1992)

- Love heals injuries and wastes less time than revenge

**Revenge:**
- Marcus Aurelius: best revenge is to not be like the offender (Meditations, 6.6)
- Seneca: vengeance wastes time and exposes you to more harm (On Anger, 3.27.2)
- Responding with hatred or desire for retaliation is not productive.

#### Embracing Patience and Understanding in Human Interactions

**Don't Get Mad: Seek Understanding and Compassion**

**Aurelius' Advice**:
- Don't respond to rudeness with more rudeness, as it only proves the other person's behavior was justified
- Be the example you want others to follow
- Avoid getting angry when people make mistakes or have character flaws
- Use reason and conversation to help others improve, rather than reacting in anger

**The Person Next to You**:
- When someone is being rude or obnoxious, it may be tempting to feel angry and wish for them to change
- However, this attitude of expecting others to magically change on their own may lead to an unrealistic and frustrating perspective
- Instead, try to give people the benefit of the doubt: assume that their behavior is often due to ignorance or accident
- Engage in a calm conversation to address the issue and find a solution

**Aurelius' Quotes**:
- "Are you angry when someone’s armpits stink or when their breath is bad? What would be the point? Having such a mouth and such armpits, there’s going to be a smell emanating. You say, they must have sense, can’t they tell how they are offending others? Well, you have sense too, congratulations. So, use your natural reason to awaken theirs, call it out."
- "Everything turns on your assumptions about it, and that’s on you. You can pluck out the hasty judgment at will, and like steering a ship around the point, you will find calm seas, fair weather and a safe port."

  - Focus on being the best person in present moment instead of considering opinions of future people
- Alexander the Great's questionable actions and admirability
  - Fought pointless wars, had terrible temper, ruthless ambition
  - Legacy irrelevant to individuals as it cannot be experienced

**Self-Improvement vs. Being a Better Person**

  - Display other inherent qualities: honesty, dignity, endurance, chastity, contentment, frugality, kindness, freedom, persistence, and avoiding gossip.
- Blaming circumstances for lack of certain qualities is futile.

#### Three Aspects of Philosophy: Living Wisely

**The Fountain of Goodness**
- **Quote by Marcus Aurelius**: "Dig deep within yourself, for there is a fountain of goodness ever ready to flow if you will keep digging."
- Goodness isn't something that comes to us; we must find it within ourselves.
- Goodness is found in our thoughts and actions, not external circumstances.

**Two Essential Tasks**
- **Quote by Epictetus**: "What, then, makes a person free from hindrance and self-determining? For wealth doesn't, neither does high-office, state or kingdom—rather, something else must be found...in the case of living, it is the knowledge of how to live."
- The two essential tasks are:
  - To be a good person
  - To pursue the occupation that we love
- Everything else is a "waste of energy and a squandering of your potential"

**Three Parts, One Aim**
- **Quote by Seneca**: "The best and the greatest number of authors have asserted that philosophy consists of three parts: the moral, the natural, and the rational. The first puts the soul in order. The second thoroughly examines the natural order of things. The third inquires into the proper meaning of words, and their arrangements and proofs which keep falsehoods from creeping in to displace truth."
- These three parts have one aim: To help us live a good life ruled by reason.

**We Reap What We Sow**
- **Quote by Seneca (as the character Thyestes)**: "Crimes often return to their teacher."
- It's ironic that Seneca, who advised others on how to be good, became the mentor to the evil emperor Nero.

#### The Dangers of Unethical Relationships and Collaborations

**Seneca's Collaboration with Nero: The Cost of Hypocrisy**
* Tyrant teacher - Seneca described as a tyrant by his students due to unethical teachings
* Macbeth analogy - "Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return / To plague th’inventor"
* Seneca's collaboration with Nero ended in Nero murdering him
* Be cautious when choosing clients and associates: their past actions may influence future behavior towards you

**The Interdependence of Human Beings**
* Marcus Aurelius on human connection: "You’ll more quickly find an earthly thing kept from the earth than you will a person cut off from other human beings."
* We are social animals and need each other for support, care, and growth.

**Character vs. Fate: The Importance of Personal Morality**
* Employers often focus on past successes when hiring, but character is a better indicator of future behavior
* Heraclitus' maxim: "Character is fate."
* Building character provides long-term success and stability in various aspects of life.

**Who Gets the Lion's Share?**
* Past achievements can be misleading indicators of future success or worth
* Focusing on character as a measure of an individual allows for fair evaluation, regardless of background or track record.

#### "Embracing Life's Challenges: Stoic Wisdom on Acceptance and Gratitude"

**Seneca's Advice on Philosophy and Self-Improvement**

**The Attitude Towards Philosophy**:
- Philosophy should not be relegated to the "remnants of life" or the "leftover time" after other pursuits
- Instead, we should make dedicated time for philosophy, treating it with respect as a valuable pursuit

**The Human Condition**:
- The notion of original sin is misguided
- Human beings are born with an innate inclination towards virtue and self-mastery
- Our attraction to virtue and the common good is a fundamental part of who we are

**Acceptance and Gratitude**:
- When something unpleasant happens, it's important to have a "complete view" of the situation and a sense of gratitude
- This allows us to find meaning and value in even difficult or unfortunate circumstances

#### Embracing Fate: The Stoic Approach to Acceptance and Gratitude

**Stoic Philosophy: Accepting and Loving What Happens**

**The Easiest Thing to Change**
- Our opinion or a past event? The latter is easier to change

**Acceptance vs. Enjoyment**
- Stoicism teaches "acquiescence": accepting rather than fighting life's events
- Going further, Stoics urge us to enjoy what happens - "amor fati" (love of fate)

**Binding Our Wishes to What Will Be**
- Epictetus: Binding choices with God's will leads to acceptance of outcomes
- Dwight D. Eisenhower's example: accepting the outcome of Normandy invasion

**Following the Doctor's Orders**

**Addiction and Control:**
- Addicts struggle with Step 2 due to fear of letting go and giving up control over their lives

- Marcus Aurelius' meditation on the transience of human life: "One generation passeth, and another generation cometh; but the earth abideth forever." (Meditations, 4.32)
- Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises opens with a similar Bible verse
- The wisdom contained in these words is that human beings have been doing the same things for centuries
- Attitudes and practices may come and go, but people continue to live, love, fight, cry, and laugh
- Belief that we are at the pinnacle of humanity or that this time is different has been perpetuated for centuries

**The Thing Itself Does Not Trouble Us**
- The "external thing" that troubles us is not the thing itself, but our judgment of it (Meditations, 8.47)
- Franklin D. Roosevelt's experience with polio: he was diagnosed at 39 and told his career was over
- However, he did not allow the disability to define him or cripple his personhood
- Acceptance does not equate to passivity; it requires active engagement with the situation

**The Strong Accept Responsibility**
- Marcus Aurelius: "If we judge as good and evil only the things in the power of our own choice, then there is no room left for blaming gods or being hostile to others." (Meditations, 6.41)
- President Harry Truman's philosophy: "The Buck Stops Here" - he knew that as president, he had ultimate responsibility and could not pass the blame to anyone else.

#### Embracing Change and Personal Growth Through Stoic Philosophy

**Attitude Towards Life Events**
- **Control Our Attitudes and Responses**: We control how we react to events, not the events themselves
- **Responsibility**: There is no one to pass the buck to, it ends with us
- **Complaining and Explaining**: Avoid complaining and making excuses as they accomplish nothing

**Choosing Outcomes**
- **Perspective on Suffering**: An event itself is objective, how we describe it is up to us
- **Malcolm X's Transformation**: He turned a negative experience into a positive one through acceptance and self-improvement

**Embracing Change**
- **Constant State of Change**: Life and we ourselves are constantly changing
- **Resentment of Change**: Leads to a wrong assumption that we have control over the outcome
- **Flow with Change**: Embrace change, don't resist it

**Hope and Fear**
- **Relationship Between Hope and Fear**: Hecato's statement - "Cease to hope and you will cease to fear"

#### Four Habits for Stoic Mind Mastery

**Seneca's Letters on Stoicism**

**Fear and Hope**:
- The primary cause of illness is adapting ourselves to future circumstances instead of the present moment
- Fear and hope are considered the same by Hecato as an enemy of the present moment and opposed to "amor fati"
- Both fear and hope contain a dangerous amount of "want" and "worry", which causes the problem

**Philosophy and Judgment**:
- Philosophy should be focused inward to make oneself better, not to judge others
- Other people's faults are their own to address, not ours to concern ourselves with

**Four Habits of the Stoic Mind**:
- 1. Accept only what is true
- 2. Direct impulses only to acts for the common good
- 3. Limit desires and aversions to what's in one's own power
- 4. Embrace everything nature assigns

**Maxims from Three Wise Men**:
- "Lead on God and Destiny" - Embrace necessity with tolerance and flexibility
- "Whoever embraces necessity is wise" - Skilled in divine matters
- "If it pleases the gods, so be it" - Gods may kill or hurt us, but can't prevent us from living our lives

#### "Finding Peace in Perspective: Embracing the Circle of Life"

**Cleanthes and Euripides on Destiny and Fate**

**Destiny and Fate**:
- Belief in a greater or higher power (God/gods) means no event goes contrary to plan
- Even without deity, events make sense when viewed from a broader perspective
- Each event is willed to happen specifically for you, not fight against it

**Perspective on Time**:
- Events today are the same as those that have always occurred
- Present moment is a "quotation" of moments before and after
- Calming, centering effect to see present as part of an eternal cycle

**Wisdom and Happiness**:
- A good deed or wise moment lasts forever, not increased by time
- Medals won in the past or future are just as valuable as current achievement
- Experiencing true happiness allows us to return to the struggle like everyone else

#### Embracing Impermanence: The Zen Master's Wisdom on Letting Go

**The Zen Master and The Broken Glass**
- Zen master enjoyed a beautiful prized cup
- Repeated to himself "The glass is already broken"
- Enjoyed, used, and showed off the cup

- Devastation occurs when unexpected events shake our assumptions
- Preparation and acceptance reduce shock

**Attachments Are The Enemy**
- Epictetus' story of a stolen lamp
- Replaced it with a cheaper one to avoid attachment
- Attachments hinder choice and adaptability
- Cause unhappiness as they are beyond our control
- Difficulty in letting go leads to slavery to the status quo
- Change is constant, only permanent thing is reasoned choice.

**Letting Go of What's Not Yours**
- Loss brings pangs: don't treat it like part of self
- Remember it as a "breakable glass" and accept change
- During happy moments, hold back wishes to avoid attachment
- Accept mortality and adaptability in all relationships.

#### On Mortality and Contentment: Lessons from Ancient Philosophers

**Reminders from Epictetus**
