## cognitivetech/obook_summary:q5_k_m

### Introduction

**The Power of Informed Gossip**

**Setting**: Office watercooler
- Place where opinions are shared and gossip exchanged

**Benefits of Gossip**:
- Identify and label mistakes of others
- Enjoyable to discuss judgments and choices
- Motivation for serious self-criticism

**Importance of Diagnostic Labels**:
- Helps recognize patterns in errors (biases)
- Easier to anticipate, understand, and communicate

**The Mind's Inner Workings**:
- Most impressions, intuitions, and decisions arise without conscious awareness
- Focus on biases does not denigrate human intelligence

**Overall Context**:
- Discussing biases in judgments and choices is important but doesn't diminish human intelligence
- Most people are healthy most of the time, and our judgments and actions are usually appropriate.

#### The Influence of Amos Tversky on Decision-Making Research

**Improving Understanding of Judgment and Decision Making Errors**

**Goal**:
- Improve ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice in others and eventually in ourselves
- Provide a richer, more precise language to discuss these errors

**Background:**
- This book presents the current understanding of judgment and decision making shaped by recent psychological discoveries
- Traces central ideas to a 1969 seminar at Hebrew University of Jerusalem

**Seminar**:
- Amos Tversky, a rising star in decision research, was guest speaker
- Discussed intuitive statistics: Are people good intuitive statisticians?
- Concluded that intuitions were deficient and planned a study on this topic with the author

**Study Design:**
- Prepared a survey of realistic statistical issues in research
- Collected responses from expert participants at Society of Mathematical Psychology meeting
  - Included authors of two statistical textbooks

#### Collaborative Research: Intuitive Statistical Predictions

**Findings from a Study on Intuitive Statistical Thinking:**
* Expert colleagues similarly exaggerated likelihood of experiment replication
* Poor advice given to graduate student regarding observation needs
* Statisticians showed poor intuitive statistical understanding

**Collaboration Between Amos Tversky and the Author:**
* Enjoys working together, found humor in each other's presence
* Strived for perfection with patience
* Checked criticism at the door
* Collaborated on long walks for many years
* Research was a conversation with jointly examined intuitive answers
* Identified and analyzed the intuitive answer first that came to mind
* Belief that their shared intuition would be widespread and easy to demonstrate.

**Theory Development:**
* Discovered identical predictions about children's future professions
* Based on resemblance of children to cultural stereotypes
* Developed theory about role of resemblance in predictions
* Tested and elaborated theory in numerous experiments.

#### Heuristics and Bias in Judgment and Decision Making

**Personality Traits and Occupations:** Steve's Description
- Steve described as shy, withdrawn, helpful, uninterested in people or reality, meek, tidy, and passionate for detail
- Resemblance to a stereotypical librarian often overlooked due to relying on heuristic (simplifying rule of thumb)
- Statistical considerations ignored: there are more farmers than librarians in the U.S.
- Participants in experiments made biased judgments based on resemblance rather than statistics

**Availability Heuristic:** Reliance on Ease of Memory Search
- Amos and I studied rates of divorce among professors at universities
- Noticed reliance on availability heuristic: easier to recall divorced professors
- Participants expected letters to appear more frequently as first letter instead of third position due to availability heuristic in word association tasks.

**Biases of Intuitive Thinking:**
- Assigning probabilities to events, forecasting future, assessing hypotheses, and estimating frequencies
- Documented various biases using experiments and studies.

#### Heuristics and Biases: Cognitive Shortcuts in Judgment and Decision Making

**Background:**
- Collaboration began in fifth year with publication in Science magazine (1970s)
- Described findings on intuitive thinking, heuristics, biases
- Challenged assumptions about human nature: rationality and emotions
- Attracted significant attention, remains highly cited work

**Impact:**
- Used productively across various fields: medical diagnosis, legal judgment, intelligence analysis, philosophy, finance, statistics, military strategy
- Influenced understanding of public interest in media: availability heuristic

**Historical Context:**
- Social scientists relied on certain assumptions about human nature
  - People are generally rational
  - Emotions cause departure from rationality
- Our article challenged both assumptions without direct discussion

**Findings:**
- Documented systematic errors in normal people's thinking
- Attributed errors to the design of cognition, not emotions

**Impact on Media and Public Interest:**
- Availability heuristic: public interest determined by media coverage
  - Salient issues are often dramatic or involve celebrities
- Authoritarian regimes exert pressure on independent media to control narrative

**Methodology:**
- Included full text of research questions in publications for demonstration purposes.

#### The Power of Demonstration in Shaping Psychological Insights

**Research on Judgment and Decision Making:**
* Demonstrations used to observe potential flaws in thinking (2004)
	+ Opportunity for scholars from various disciplines
	+ Revealed human mind's susceptibility to systematic errors
* Initial reactions were not uniformly positive: focus on biases criticized as negative view of the mind
* Some investigators refined ideas, others offered alternatives
* Now generally accepted that our minds are prone to errors in judgment and decision making
* Switched focus to decision making under uncertainty (2009)
* Goal: develop a psychological theory of how people make decisions about simple gambles
	+ Examined intuitive preferences using logic of choice
	+ Observed systematic biases in own decisions, inconsistent with rational choice rules
* Published "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk" (2009)
	+ One foundation of behavioral economics.

#### Expert Intuition and Everyday Marvels in Decision-Making

**Collaboration between Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman:**
- Shared exceptional mind superior to individual abilities (Nobel Prize in 2002)
- Focus on biases in intuitive thought
- Recent developments: understanding the strengths and flaws of intuition

**Intuitive Thought:**
- Not an exposition of early research with Amos Tversky
- Presenting a view of how the mind works using recent cognitive and social psychology developments
- Important development: understanding accurate intuitions beyond biases

**Accurate Intuition:**
- Expert intuition vs. flawed intuition
- Examples: firefighter's sixth sense, chess master, physician's diagnosis
- Everyday abilities also involve intuitive expertise
- No magic involved in accurate intuition.

#### The Role of Emotion in Expert Intuition and Decision Making

**Expert Intuition vs. Mythologized Gut Feeling**
- **Herbert A. Simon**: studied chess masters, showed expert intuition is recognition of cues and access to stored information
- "Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition"
- Experts learn to recognize elements in a situation and make appropriate judgments or actions

**Limitations of Expert Intuition**
- Not all professional intuitions arise from true expertise:
  - Example: executive investing in Ford stock based on liking cars at automobile show
    - Lack of consideration for relevance question (is it underpriced?)
- **Affect heuristic**: judgments and decisions guided by feelings of liking and disliking
- When a problem is difficult, intuition may still provide a quick but incorrect answer
  - When expertise is not available, intuitive solution may not be relevant to the original question.

#### Understanding Intuitive Thinking and Overconfidence: A Two-System Model

**The Distinction Between Fast and Slow Thinking:**

**Intuitive Heuristics**:
- Difficult questions are often answered by addressing easier related questions
- This substitution occurs without conscious awareness

**Two Systems of Thought**:
- **System 1 (Fast Thinking)**: Automatic mental processes, including perception, memory, and intuitive judgment
- **System 2 (Slow Thinking)**: Deliberate, effortful thought

**Structure of the Book:**
1. Part 1: Introduction to a Two-Systems Approach
   - Distinction between automatic and controlled operations
   - The role of associative memory in intuitive thinking
2. Part 2: Understanding Judgment Heuristics
   - Challenges in statistical thinking
   - Excessive confidence in beliefs and underestimation of uncertainty
3. (Not covered in this text) Part 3: Overconfidence and Its Consequences
   - The illusory certainty of hindsight
4. (Not covered in this text) Part 4: Affective and Emotional Processing
5. (Not covered in this text) Part 5: Decision Making Under Complex Conditions

#### Two-System Model and Behavioral Economics: Exploring Rationality and Selfhood

**Influence from Nassim Taleb's "The Black Swan"**
- Hope for watercooler conversations that explore lessons from the past while resisting hindsight and certainty

**Focus of Part 4: Conversation with Economics on Rationality**
- Provides current view informed by two-system model on key concepts in prospect theory
- Addresses ways human choices deviate from rationality, such as:
  - Treating problems in isolation
  - Framing effects, where decisions shaped by inconsequential features of choice problems

**Part 5: Two Selves and Well-being**
- Introduces distinction between experiencing self and remembering self, which have different interests
- Exposes people to painful experiences that leave better memories due to automatic memory formation (System 1)
- Distinction applied to measurement of well-being, where experiencing self's happiness differs from remembering self's satisfaction
- Raises questions about individuals and societies pursuing population happiness

**Concluding Chapter: Implications of Distinctions Drawn**
- Reviews implications of the distinctions between:
  - Experiencing and remembering selves
  - Classical vs. behavioral economics (agents)
  - System 1 vs. System 2 (automatic vs. effortful)
- Returns to importance of educating "gossip" and how organizations can improve judgments and decisions

**Appendixes:**
- Reproduction of two articles written with Amos:
  - Review of judgment under uncertainty (described earlier)
  - Summary of prospect theory and framing effects (published in 1984)
- Gives sense of what was known a long time ago and what has been learned since

### 1. The Characters of the Story

**Systems of Thinking: System 1 and System 2**

**Introduction:**
- Observe automatic vs intuitive thinking through the examples of an angry woman's face and a multiplication problem
- Introduce Systems 1 and 2 as two mental processes

**System 1:**
- Operates automatically and quickly
- Little to no effort required
- No sense of voluntary control
- Examples: recognizing emotions, solving simple problems
- Involves both mind and body

**System 2:**
- Allocates attention to mental activities
- Effortful and deliberate
- Subjective experience of agency, choice, concentration
- Examples: complex computations, reasoning, decision making

**Comparison between Systems:**
- System 1: fast, automatic, instinctual
- System 2: slow, effortful, conscious

**Examples:**
*Look at the woman’s face*
  - Intuitive thinking (System 1)
  - Seamless combination of seeing and intuition
  *Multiplication problem*
  - Slower, more deliberate thought process (System 2)
  - Involves more mental effort and concentration

**Conclusion:**
- Both systems are crucial for functioning
- Understanding them can help us comprehend the complexities of human thinking.

#### Dual Systems of Cognition and Attention: Automatic and Voluntary Processes

**System 1 Automatic Activities:**
- **Detecting Distance**: One object is more distant than another
- **Orientation to Sound**: Orient to source of sudden sound
- **Complete Phrases**: Make "bread and..." phrases complete
- **Emotional Reactions**: Make "disgust face" when shown horrible picture, detect hostility in a voice
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Answer 2 + 2 = ?
- **Visual Processing**: Read words on large billboards
- **Driving**: Drive a car on an empty road
- **Cognitive Skills**: Understand simple sentences, recognize occupational stereotypes
- **Innate Skills**: Perceive world, recognize objects, orient attention, avoid losses, fear spiders
- **Learned Associations and Skills**: Find strong chess moves, widely shared or specialized

**System 1 Capabilities:**
- Innate skills: shared with other animals
- Fast and automatic through practice
- Store knowledge in memory without effort
- Automatic pilot for some skills (chewing)
- Attention control shared between systems

**System 2 Voluntary Activities:**
- Brace for race start
- Focus on specific objects/people
- Monitor behavior in social situations
- Maintain faster walking speed
- Memorize and identify unexpected information

**Common Feature of System 2:**
- Require attention
- Disrupted when attention is drawn away.

#### Limited Attention Capacity and Its Impact on Cognitive Tasks

**Attention and Consciousness**

**The Role of Attention:**
- Paying attention is a limited resource, requiring effort
- Effortful activities interfere with each other
- Intense focus on a task can make people effectively blind to other stimuli

**Effects of Distractions:**
- Difficulty in conducting multiple demanding tasks at once
- Overlooking important information (e.g., the gorilla in the basketball video)

**The Impact of Effort on Attention:**
- System 2 has some ability to change System 1 functions, such as attention and memory
- Setting your focus on a specific task requires continuous effort

**Examples of Demanding Tasks:**
- Waiting for someone at a busy train station
- Filling out tax forms
- Comparing washing machines for overall value
- Checking the validity of logical arguments

**Social Behavior and Attention:**
- Allowances are made for attention limitations in social situations (e.g., driving, conversation)
- Intense focus on a task can make people effectively blind to other stimuli, even those that are normally attention-grabbing.

#### Dual Processes of the Mind: Automatic vs Conscious Thinking

**The Dual Nature of Human Attention: Systems 1 and 2**

**Background:**
- Thousands have seen gorilla video
- Half miss gorilla due to counting task
- System 1: automatic functions of attention
- System 2: conscious processing

**System 1:**
- Runs automatically
- Generates suggestions for System 2 (impressions, intuitions)
- Beliefs and actions result from endorsed suggestions
- Normal operation most of the time

**Challenges for System 1:**
- Calls on System 2 when problems arise
- Activated by surprising events or violations of expected models

**System 2:**
- Conscious processing
- Mobilized during difficult situations
- Continuous monitoring of behavior
- Increased effort when detecting errors

**Interplay between Systems:**
- Most actions originate in System 1
- System 2 takes over when difficulties are encountered
- Ultimately, System 2 has the final say.

#### Conflict between Automatic Responses and Intentional Control in Cognitive Processes

**Systems 1 and 2:**
- **Division of labor**: efficient, minimizes effort, optimizes performance
- System 1: models familiar situations accurately, reacts swiftly to challenges
- System 2: engages in tasks not routinely done, requires focus and effort

**System 1 Limitations:**
- Biases leading to systematic errors
- Limited understanding of logic and statistics
- Cannot be turned off

**Experiment:**
- Figure 2 creates a conflict between Systems 1 and 2
- Easier tasks: left column (upper/lower or right/left)
- Harder tasks: right column (words for which you were set)
- Overcoming competing response was a strain, slowed down performance
- Conflict experienced as trying not to stare at something unwanted or focusing on boring content

**Real Life Examples:**
- Trying not to stare at oddly dressed couple in a restaurant
- Struggling to focus on a boring book
- Driving experience: steering into skid, avoiding brakes during emergencies
- Personal experience of not telling someone something hurtful.

#### Understanding and Overcoming Cognitive Illusions

**System 1 and System 2**:
- **System 1**: Impulses and impressions
- **System 2**: Self-control and conscious thought
- System 1's impression of the Müller-Lyer illusion: Bottom line is longer
- System 2's belief after measurement: Identical length
- System 1's perspective cannot be changed, only System 2's belief can
- To overcome the illusion, mistrust System 1's impression and rely on System 2's measured belief

**Cognitive Illusions**:
- Not limited to visual illusions
- Examples: Patients with multiple failed treatments, psychopathic charm
- System 1's feelings are not under our control, but System 2 can recognize danger signs (like repeated treatment failures) and make informed decisions.

#### Understanding Cognitive Illusions: System 1 vs. System 2

**Cognitive Illusions and the Limits of System 1 and System 2**

**System 1 and System 2**:
- System 1: Automatic, unconscious system that operates without effort
- System 2: Conscious, effortful system that requires monitoring and effort

**Cognitive Illusions**:
- An illusion - a cognitive bias that can lead to errors in thinking
- Difficult to prevent because System 1 operates automatically
- Errors can be avoided by enhanced monitoring and effortful activity of System 2

**Limitations of Continuous Vigilance**:
- Constant questioning of own thinking is impractical
- System 2 is slow and inefficient compared to System 1

**Useful Fictions**:
- Describing Systems 1 and 2 as agents within the mind is a shorthand for their characteristics
- The sentences about Systems 1 and 2 are descriptive, not explanatory
- They imply certain aspects of how each system functions

**Clarification on System 1 and System 2**:
- Not standard entities with interacting parts
- No single part of the brain specifically dedicated to either system

**Importance of Fictitious Characters**:
- Introducing fictitious characters helps clarify the concepts being discussed
- Provides a way to understand complex ideas more easily.

### 2. Attention and Effort

**Systems 1 and 2**:
- Characters are useful due to quirks of the mind
- Sentences understood easier when describing actions of an agent (System 2) vs. properties of something (mental arithmetic)
- Mind has special aptitude for constructing and interpreting stories about active agents with personalities, habits, abilities
- "System 1" and "System 2" are nicknames, not descriptive terms
	+ Longer names like "automatic system" and "effortful system" take up more working memory
	+ Reduces ability to think

**System 2**:
- Operates effortfully
- Characterized by laziness and reluctance to invest more than necessary
- Often guided by System 1's impressions and impulses
- Vital tasks require effort and self-control that only System 2 can perform

**Mental Effort**:
- Exercise to test cognitive abilities: "Add-1" exercise
	+ Generate strings of 4 digits, increment each by 1 within 5 seconds
	+ Keep steady rhythm to challenge cognitive abilities

#### Mental Effort and Pupil Dilation in Addition Tasks

**The Add-1 Task Challenge**
- Few people can handle more than four digits in the Add-1 task
- For a harder challenge, try Add-3
- If you want to know what your body does during mental work, set up two piles of books on a sturdy table
- Place a video camera on one pile and lean your chin on the other
- Get the video going and stare at the camera lens while working on Add-1 or Add-3 exercises
- Later, you will find changes in the size of your pupils reflect how hard you worked

**Personal History with the Add-1 Task**
- Spent a year at University of Michigan studying hypnosis
- Found an article by psychologist Eckhard Hess on the pupil of the eye as a window to the soul
- Hess's findings:
  - Pupils widen when viewing attractive nature pictures
  - Dilated pupils indicate mental effort, not emotional arousal
  - Pupils dilate more during hard mental tasks like multiplying two-digit numbers

**Pupil Dilation as an Indicator of Mental Effort**
- Graduate student Jackson Beatty shared the author's enthusiasm
- Developed a setup to study pupil dilation during mental tasks
  - Participant leaned on chin-and-forehead rest, stared at camera
  - Answered questions or repeated/transformed digits in response to metronome beats
  - Pupil images were captured every second and measured with a ruler
- Focused on paced tasks like Add-1 to precisely track what the subject was thinking

#### The Dynamic Pupil: Measuring Mental Effort

**Pupil Size and Cognitive Effort**

**Discoveries about Pupil Dilation**:
- Pupil size reflects cognitive demands of tasks
- Shape is an inverted V: effort builds, peaks, then relaxes
- Longer strings cause larger dilations
- Transformation task compounds effort
- Peak pupil size coincides with maximum effort

**Observations from Basement Suite**:
- Dilation and heart rate increase during hard tasks
- Participants give up if too much is asked of them
- Pupil shrinks when overloaded
- Fascinating to observe pupil dilation and contraction
- Could surprise participants by asking why they stopped working

**Informal Observations**:
- Pupil remains small during mundane conversation
- Indicates tasks are normally not very effortful

**Mental Life Metaphor**:
- Normally conducted at a comfortable walk pace
- Sometimes jogging or sprinting (high cognitive effort)

#### Mental Effort and Selective Attention in Cognitive Processes

**Add-1 and Add-3 Exercises**
* Sprint activities: Add-1 and Add-3 exercises
* Mental effort can lead to blindness
* Example of blindness during Add-1: observers missed target letter when mentally busy
	+ Changes in ability to detect and report target followed same pattern as dilating pupil
	+ Reassuring similarity between pupil response and mental energy usage

**Pupils and Mental Energy Usage**
* Pupils offer an index of current rate of mental energy use
* Use of electricity analogy: limited capacity but responds differently to overload
* System 2 protection: important activities receive priority attention, spare capacity allocated secondarily

**Gorilla Experiment Findings**
* Participants instructed to prioritize digit task in gorilla experiment
* High demand for mental effort led to selective precision in attention allocation
* Subjects did not see critical letter during high-demand periods
* Better detection performance when transformation task less demanding.

#### Understanding Cognitive Effort and Mental Demand

**Effect of Skidding Incident:**
- Response to threat occurs before consciousness
- Collaboration between Beatty and author led to significant career advancements
  - Beatty: cognitive pupillometry expert
  - Author: wrote "Attention and Effort" based on their learnings

**Understanding the Working Mind (System 2):**
- Studies of pupils in various tasks revealed information about System 2
- As skill increases, energy demands decrease
- Brain activity patterns change with increased skill
- Intelligence affects effort required for problem solving
- "Law of least effort" applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion
- People gravitate towards least demanding ways of achieving goals

**Effects of Tasks on Pupil Size:**
- Baseline: awake, aware, and ready to engage
- Minimal effects from holding digits in memory or learning associations (3 = door)
- Larger dilations for discriminating pitch tones
- Inhibiting distracting words induces moderate effort
- Short-term memory tests for several digits are more demanding
- Retrieving phone numbers or birthdays requires brief but significant effort
- Mental multiplication and Add-3 task near the limit of what most people can do

**Factors Affecting Cognitive Effort:**
- Maintaining multiple ideas requiring separate actions
- Combining ideas according to rules (rehearsing shopping list, choosing between options)
- System 2 capabilities: what it can do that System 1 cannot.

#### Dual Processing Systems: Cognitive Operations & Executive Control

**System 2 Capabilities:**
* Follows rules
* Compares objects on multiple attributes
* Deliberate choices between options
* Adopts task sets (programs memory to obey instructions)
* Resolves conflicts
* Involved in executive function and intelligence
* Switches between tasks is effortful, especially under time pressure

**System 2 Functions:**
* Detects complex relations
* Integrates information about one thing
* Deals with multiple distinct topics at once
* Uses statistical information
* Holds several digits in working memory for addition or mental multiplication tasks
* Requires rapid switching between tasks
* Predicts performance of air traffic controllers and Israeli Air Force pilots beyond intelligence.

**System 2 Challenges:**
* Effortful to set up and carry out new tasks (like counting letters or commas)
* Overcoming newly acquired tendencies from previous tasks is difficult
* Time pressure drives the pace, forcing refreshment of information in memory.

### 3. The Lazy Controller

**Mental Effort and Attention**

**Observations about Mental Exertion**:
- Uncomfortable when working memory is insufficient
- Rare for mental tasks to be as demanding as Add-3 or storing digits for recall
- Normally divide tasks into easy steps, avoid mental overload
- Law of least effort: think as little as possible

**Mental Exertion vs. Mental Alertness**:
- 17 minutes/mile walk is experienced as a stroll, no strain or need to push
- Monitoring environment and thoughts demands little effort
- Walking and thinking at the same time is easy, but heavy mental loads compete for resources

**Experiment**:
- Asking someone to do complex math calculation while walking leads to stopping in tracks

#### The Psychology of Flow and Self-Control: Effortless Concentration and Mental Work

**Slow Thinking and Effortful Cognition:**
- Prefer sitting, still environment for intense concentration (Amos Tippett)
- Intense concentration impairs ability to think coherently at higher speeds
- Physical effort required for rapid movement
- Mental effort of self-control needed to maintain faster pace
- Frequent switching of tasks and speeded-up mental work not intrinsically pleasurable
- Maintenance of a coherent train of thought requires discipline

**Flow:**
- State of effortless concentration
- Description: deep focus, loss of sense of time, self, problems
- Induces joy and optimal experience (Csikszentmihalyi)
- Activities that can induce flow: painting, racing motorcycles, writing a book
- Effortful tasks vs. flow state: effortful tasks require self-control, but maintaining focus in a state of flow does not.

**Self-Control and Cognitive Effort:**
- Both forms of mental work
- Studies show people yield to temptations more easily under cognitive demand
- Demanding cognitive task consumes resources for self-control.

#### The Effects of Self-Control Depletion on Behavior and Decision Making

**Cognitive Load and Self-Control**

**Imagine being asked to remember a list of digits**:
- This cognitive task can lead to choosing "sinful" options (e.g., chocolate cake) over "virtuous" ones (e.g., fruit salad)
- When **System 1** has more influence, it can result in:
    - **Selfish choices** in social situations
    - **Use of sexist language**
    - **Superficial judgments**

**Cognitive Busyness and Self-Control**:
- People who are **cognitively busy** are more likely to exhibit weak self-control
- This can be due to factors like:
    - Consuming a few drinks
    - Sleeplessness
    - Being an "evening" (night) person vs. a "morning" person

**Self-Control as a Cognitive Task**:
- **Self-control** requires attention and effort, as it is one of the tasks performed by **System 2**
- Various forms of voluntary effort draw on a shared pool of mental energy, known as **ego depletion**
- Examples of ego-depleting tasks:
    - Stifling emotional reactions to emotionally charged events
    - Resisting food temptations (e.g., chocolate vs. radishes/celery)
    - Avoiding white bears in a cognitive task
    - Trying to impress others
    - Interacting with people of different races (for prejudiced individuals)
- Indicators of ego depletion:
    - Deviating from a diet
    - Overspending on impulsive purchases
    - Reacting aggressively to provocation
    - Persisting less in a handgrip task
    - Performing poorly in cognitive tasks and logical decision making

**Motivational Aspects of Ego Depletion**:
- After exerting self-control in one task, there is a reduced motivation to make an effort in another task
- However, the effects of ego depletion can be mitigated with strong incentives.

#### "Glucose and Ego Depletion: Impact on Decision-Making"

**Ego Depletion and Glucose Levels**
- **Ego depletion**: not the same as cognitive busyness
- Nervous system consumes more glucose than other parts of the body during effortful mental activity
- Blood glucose levels drop during difficult cognitive reasoning or tasks requiring self-control

**Implications:**
- Effects of ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose
- Baumeister's group confirmed this hypothesis through experiments

**Experiment 1:**
- Volunteers watched a short silent film and interpreted body language
- Participants performed self-control task (ignoring words)
- Half drank lemonade sweetened with glucose, others with Splenda
- Glucose drinkers had better performance than those on Splenda

**Experiment 2:**
- Unwitting parole judges in Israel studied
- Approval rates spiked after meals and dropped steadily until next meal

#### The Bat-and-Ball Puzzle and Systematic Overconfidence

**The Dual-System Model of Decision Making: System 1 and System 2**

**Background:**
- Study by authors investigates parole decisions by tired and hungry judges
- Default position for denying parole is an unwelcome result
- Checked alternative explanations, best account: fatigue and hunger play a role

**The Lazy System 1**
- Monitors and controls thoughts and actions suggested by System 2
- Allows some to be expressed directly in behavior, suppresses or modifies others

**The Bat-and-Ball Puzzle:**
- Simple puzzle evoking an intuitive, appealing, and wrong answer (10¢)
- Correct answer: ball costs $0.05
- People who give intuitive answer did not actively check for correctness
- Failure to check is remarkable due to low cost of checking

**Study by Shane Frederick:**
- Investigated how closely System 2 monitors suggestions from System 1 using bat-and-ball puzzle
- Intuitive answer indicates a failure to actively check, endorsing an incorrect response
- People who avoid intuitive answer have more active minds

**Surprising Results:**
- At selective universities: over 50% of students gave incorrect answer
- At less selective universities: over 80% of students failed to check

**Implications:**
- Many people are overconfident, placing too much faith in intuitions
- Avoid cognitive effort as much as possible.

#### Overcoming Cognitive Biases: The Bat-Ball Problem & Michigan Experiment

**Implications of Unsound Arguments:**
- **People are likely to believe arguments that support a conclusion they already believe, even when the arguments are unsound**
- **System 1's automatic thinking process may lead to flawed conclusions**

**The Michigan/Detroit Problem:**
- **Question**: How many murders occur in the state of Michigan in one year?
- **Challenge for System 2**: Remembering Detroit is in Michigan and its high crime rate
- **Factors affecting answer:**
  - Automatic function of memory (System 1)
  - Detail of Michigan representation in minds (varies among individuals)
  - Intelligence level and ability to reason
- **Impact on deliberate checking and search (System 2):**
  - Varies among individuals
  - Slower process for those who don't recall Detroit or its crime rate.

#### Delayed Gratification and Self-Control: Impact on Intelligence

**Mini Tests and Self-Control:**
* Insufficient motivation or lack of effort can result in failing mini tests (not trying hard enough)
* University students can solve more complex problems when not influenced by superficially plausible answers
* Some students may be intellectually "lazy," while others are "engaged" and less satisfied with easy answers
* Psychologist Keith Stanovich refers to engaged individuals as "rational"

**Research on Thinking and Self-Control:**
* Studies examine correlation between self-control and cognitive aptitude (intelligence)
* Mischel experiment: children given choice between small reward now or larger reward later, measured their ability to wait for larger reward
	+ Half the children successfully waited 15 minutes by distracting themselves from temptation
	+ Those who waited had higher executive control as young adults and were less likely to take drugs
* Oregon research team investigated link between cognitive control and intelligence: attempted to raise intelligence through improving attention control.

#### The Impact of Cognitive Control on Executive Function in Children

**Study Finds Improvements in Attention and Intelligence after Computer Games Training**
- **Five 40-minute sessions** of computer games designed to demand attention and control for children aged four to six
- Example exercise: tracking a cartoon cat to avoid muddy area, with gradually shrinking grassy area requiring progressively more precise control
- Training improved executive control and nonverbal intelligence scores, which were maintained for several months
- Research also identified specific genes involved in attention control, effects of parenting techniques, and connection between attention and emotion control

**Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) Developed to Measure Intuitive vs. Reasoning Abilities**
- **Shane Frederick's CRT**: includes bat-and-ball problem and two other intuition-challenging questions
- Low scorers on CRT: prone to accept immediate gratification, impulsive, impatient, unwilling to check intuitions
- High scorers: capable of reasoning, cautious in decision making

**Stanovich's Approach to Understanding Biases in Judgment**
- **Keith Stanovich**: introduced the concepts of System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (reflective) minds
- High intelligence does not make people immune to biases; rationality is a separate ability involved
- Rationality distinguished from intelligence: superficial or "lazy" thinking is a flaw in reflective mind, failure of rationality.

### 4. The Associative Machine

**The Bat-and-Ball Question and Associative Activation**

**Intelligence vs. Rationality**:
- The bat-and-ball question and similar exercises are better indicators of susceptibility to cognitive errors than traditional IQ tests
- Distinguishing intelligence from rationality may lead to new discoveries

**System 1 in Action**:
- The phrase "bananas vomit" evokes a range of automatic, involuntary responses:
  - Increased heart rate, raised eyebrows, sweat glands activated, etc.
  - Formation of a sketchy scenario connecting the two words
  - Temporary aversion to bananas
  - Readiness to recognize related concepts like "sick" or "fruit"
- These responses are part of an **associative cascade**: Ideas evoke other ideas, creating a coherent pattern of cognitive, emotional, and physical responses.

#### Understanding Mental Association Mechanisms through Priming Techniques

**Understanding Association of Ideas**

**The Automatic Process of Making Sense of Words**:
- Your brain quickly made sense of unexpected words by:
    - Linking them in a causal story
    - Evaluating the potential threat level
    - Creating context for future developments and the current event

**Cognition as Embodied Thinking**:
- The mind thinks with the body, not just the brain
- The association of ideas has been known since ancient times

**The Three Principles of Association**:
- **Resemblance**: Similar things are associated (e.g., lime - green)
- **Contiguity in Time and Place**: Associations based on sequence or proximity (virus - cold)
- **Causality**: Causes are linked to effects (banana - fruit)

**Expanded View of Ideas**:
- Ideas can be concrete or abstract, expressed in various ways
- Psychologists see ideas as nodes in an associative memory network

**Advancements Beyond Hume**:
- The mind does not go through a conscious sequence of ideas
- An activated idea triggers many other associated ideas, most unconsciously

**The Marvels of Priming**:
- A word's association can be measured by its impact on related words
- Exposure to a word causes immediate changes in the ease of evoking related words

#### Unconscious Priming Effects on Actions and Emotions

**Priming Effects:**

**Overview:**
- Priming effect: temporary increase in likelihood of completing a word or action based on recent exposure to related words or concepts

**Examples:**
- EAT priming SOUP over SOAP
- WASH priming SOAP instead of SOUP

**Forms of Priming Effects:**
1. **Semantic Priming**: Idea of EAT makes recognition of SOUP more likely
2. **Contextual Priming**: Idea of wobbly table primes the idea of wobbly
3. **Multiple Ripple Effects**: Activation spreads through network of associated ideas (e.g., fork, hungry, fat, diet, cookie)
4. **Subliminal Priming**: Influence on actions and emotions without conscious awareness

**Experimental Evidence:**
- John Bargh's Experiment: Students primed with elderly words walked slower down the hallway (Florida effect)
- Ideomotor effect: Thoughts influence actions, such as walking slowly or choosing an action, without conscious awareness.

**Conclusion:**
Priming effects demonstrate how recent exposure to words and concepts can impact our perception, memory, and behavior, often subconsciously. The ripple effects of priming can be far-reaching, influencing a wide range of related ideas and actions.

#### Unconscious Influences: Priming Effects on Thoughts and Feelings

**Priming Effects**

**Ideomotor Link**:
- Reading a paragraph about elderly primed readers to stand up slower or faster depending on their feelings towards the elderly
- Ideomotor link works in reverse: walking at third of normal pace for 5 minutes led to recognition of old age words

**Reciprocal Priming Effects**:
- Create coherent reactions (e.g., thinking/acting old leads to recognizing/feeling old)
- Example: holding a pencil between teeth forced a frown or smile, which affected humor perception and emotional response

**Gestures Influencing Thoughts and Feelings**:
- Nodding while listening led to acceptance of messages, shaking led to rejection
- No awareness of the unconscious influence of simple gestures on thoughts and feelings

**Priming Effects Threaten Self-Image**:
- Studies reveal our judgments and choices are influenced by unconscious priming effects

#### Money Priming and Its Impact on Individualism

**Effects of Priming on Voting Behavior:**
- **Location of polling station**: influences votes, especially for school funding initiatives
  - Support higher when polling station is in a school
  - Effect larger than difference between parents and other voters

**Effects of Money Primes:**
- Increases self-reliance and individualism
  - Participants tried solving difficult problems longer before asking for help
  - Less willing to spend time helping others
  - Preferred to be alone

**Experiments on Money Priming:**
- List of money-related words made participants more independent and selfish
  - Stayed farther apart during get-acquainted conversation
  - Showed preference for being alone

**Implications:**
- Living in a money-centric culture may shape behavior and attitudes unknowingly and unwillingly.

#### The Impact and Influence of Priming on Decision Making

**The Impact of Cultural Reminders**
- Frequent reminders of respect in some cultures
- Reminders of God in certain societies
- Large images of national leaders in dictatorial societies
- Conveys feeling of "Big Brother Is Watching" and reduces spontaneous thought and independent action
- Priming studies suggest reminding people of mortality increases appeal of authoritarian ideas

**The Role of Symbols and Metaphors**
- Ambiguous word fragments: W_ _ H, S_ _ P
- People who think about shame complete as WASH and SOAP, not WISH and SOUP
- Thinking about stabbing a coworker leads to desire for cleansing products (Lady Macbeth effect)
- Specific to body parts involved in sin

**Reactions to Priming Studies**
- Disbelief is common among audience
- System 2 believes it's in charge and knows the reasons for choices
- Effects of primes are not necessarily large but can tip elections
- Subjective experience does not reflect reality.

#### The Impact of Subconscious Priming on Behavior: An Office Study Example

**Priming Phenomena**
- Occur in **System 1**, with no conscious access

**Experiment at a British University**
- For ten weeks, a poster was displayed above the price list for an "honesty box" in an office kitchen
- The first week: wide-open eyes staring, average contribution = 70 pence per liter of milk
- Week 2: flowers instead of eyes, average contribution dropped to about 15 pence
- Users contributed almost three times as much during "eye weeks" vs. "flower weeks"
- The effect occurs without any awareness

**System 1 and Consciousness**
- System 1 provides impressions, beliefs, impulses, choices, actions
- Contains the model of the world that evaluates events as normal or surprising
- Source of rapid and precise intuitive judgments
- Operates without conscious awareness
- Origin of many systematic errors in intuitions

**Wilson's Book "Strangers to Ourselves"**
- Introduces the "stranger" within us, controlling much of our actions
- System 1 provides beliefs, choices, and actions with minimal conscious input.

### 5. Cognitive Ease

**Cognitive Ease and Strain**

**Key Concepts:**
- Multiple computations occur in the brain
- Determine whether extra effort is required from System 2
- Cognitive ease or strain affects processing

**Impact of Cognitive Ease:**
- Things are going well with no threats or need for attention
- Familiar situation, good mood, casual thinking
- Fluent processing of information (clear fonts, repeated sentences)
- Positive impacts: trust intuitions, less errors

**Causes of Cognitive Ease:**
- Clear fonts
- Repeated sentences
- Priming
- Good mood
- Factors that make you smile (pencil across mouth)

**Impact of Cognitive Strain:**
- Problem exists and requires increased mobilization of System 2
- Vigilant and suspicious thinking
- More effort invested in tasks
- Discomfort, less intuitive and creative

**Causes of Cognitive Strain:**
- Poor fonts
- Faint colors
- Complicated language
- Bad mood
- Situations that make you frown.

#### Illusion of Familiarity and its Effects on Perception

**Familiarity Illusion**

**Background:**
- Study by Larry Jacoby on how names can appear familiar despite being new
- Participants shown list of names, some famous, some unknown
- Feelings of familiarity arise from cognitive ease in perceiving a word

**Causes of Familiarity Illusion:**
1. **Easier Perception**: Words that have been seen before are easier to identify due to:
   - Better recognition during brief presentations or masking
   - Quicker reading time compared to unfamiliar words
2. **Cognitive Ease and Strain**: Cognitive ease increases the likelihood of a word being perceived as familiar, while cognitive strain decreases it.
3. **Interchangeability of Techniques**: Methods that induce cognitive ease or strain are interchangeable; participants may not know what is causing their feelings.

**Effects of Familiarity Illusion:**
1. **Mistaking Unfamiliar for Familiar**: Participants mistakenly identify new names as familiar due to the illusion of pastness created by cognitive ease during perception.
2. **Recognizing Blurred Words**: When shown a list of words with varying degrees of clarity, participants are more likely to recognize and perceive clearer words, even if they have never seen them before.

**Familiarity vs. Truth:**
1. **Mistaking Familiarity for Truth**: The familiarity illusion can lead people to mistake familiarity for truth in statements, such as believing "New York is a large city" or "The moon revolves around Earth," despite these statements being objectively false or unrelated to the given names.
2. **Importance of Critical Thinking**: Recognizing this effect and practicing critical thinking can help individuals avoid being misled by familiarity illusion and make accurate judgments based on objective information.

#### The Psychology of Cognitive Ease and Belief Persuasion

**Cognitive Ease and Believability of Statements**

**Understanding Cognitive Ease:**
- Associative machinery slows judgment for more obvious falsehoods
- System 2 relies on familiarity for true/false judgments
- Predictable illusions can occur when based on cognitive ease

**Implications for Believability:**
- Familiarity not easily distinguished from truth
- Authoritarian institutions and marketers use repetition to make falsehoods seem true
- Studies of "truth illusions" provide suggestions to help increase believability

**Maximizing Legibility for Persuasive Messages:**
- Reduce cognitive strain by improving legibility
- Enlisting cognitive ease to work in favor when crafting persuasive messages.

#### The Influence of Language and Psychology on Perception and Credibility

**Importance of Credibility and Believability in Communication:**
- **False statements**: Adolf Hitler's birth year (1892 or 1887 vs. 1889)
- Experiments show that more familiar year is more likely to be believed

**Maximizing Credibility through Presentation:**
- Use high-quality paper for printed messages
- Use bright colors for text (bright blue or red)
- Avoid complex language, use simpler words instead

**The Effect of Rhyming and Easily Pronounced Names:**
- Participants believed aphorisms more when they rhyme
- Easily pronounced source names (e.g., Artan) were given more weight in evaluating reports

**System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking:**
- **System 1**: automatic, intuitive thinking that requires little mental effort
- **System 2**: conscious, rational thinking that requires mental effort
- High-quality paper, bright colors, and rhyming/simple language can help bypass System 1's laziness but won't save an obviously nonsensical or contradictory message.

**Importance of Credibility:**
- Believability plays a significant role in the impact of our communication
- People often rely on intuitive impressions from System 1 thinking, even if they may not be aware of it
- To ensure credibility, consider using strategies like those mentioned above while maintaining accuracy and factuality.

#### Cognitive Strain and System 1-2 Interplay

**Cognitive Ease and Strain**

**Associative Coherence**:
- Strongly linked by logic or association to other beliefs/preferences
- Comes from a source you trust and like
- Can lead to feelings of cognitive ease
- Difficult to tease apart from other causes (e.g., font, prose rhythm)

**Cognitive Strain**:
- Experienced when the effortful operations of System 2 are engaged
- Tends to mobilize System 2, shifting approach from intuitive to analytic
- Can be induced by factors like font and prose rhythm

**Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT)**:
- Consists of puzzles designed to evoke an immediate, incorrect intuitive answer
- Correct answers:
  - Bat-and-ball problem: 100 minutes
  - Lily pads problem: 47 days

**Experiment**:
- 40 Princeton students took the CRT
- Half saw the puzzles in a normal font, half in a barely legible font
- Results showed that cognitive strain (from font) led to more mistakes, while cognitive ease (from bad font) led to fewer mistakes
- This is because cognitive strain mobilizes System 2, which is more likely to reject the intuitive answer suggested by System 1

**Cognitive Ease and Pleasure**:
- An article described an experiment where participants were shown pictures of objects
- The article's title "Mind at Ease Puts a Smile on the Face" suggests that cognitive ease can lead to positive emotions (e.g., a smile)

#### Mere Exposure Effect: Repetition and Positive Association

**Effects of Cognitive Ease on Emotional Reactions:**
- **Easy-to-recognize images**: outline shown before complete image, associated with good feelings (System 1)
  - Faint smile and relaxed brows during recognition

**Measurement of Emotional Reactions:**
- Electrical impulses from facial muscles record changes of expression
- Difficult for observers to detect

**Words Pronounceability and Stock Performance:**
- Easily pronounced words evoke favorable attitude (System 1)
- Companies with pronounceable names perform better initially
- Stocks with pronounceable tickers outperform those with tongue-twisting symbols

**Mere Exposure Effect:**
- Repetition induces cognitive ease and comforting feeling of familiarity
- Robert Zajonc's research on the link between repetition, affection, and cognition (mere exposure effect)

**Experiment at University of Michigan and Michigan State University:**
- Ads with Turkish words displayed on front pages of student newspapers: kadirga, saricik, biwonjni, nansoma, iktitaf
  - Frequency of appearance varied from one to twenty-five times
- Results showed that more frequently presented words were rated more favorably

**Mere Exposure Effect Demonstration:**
- No explanation or acknowledgment given for the series of ads
- Questionnaires sent out after the experiment ended to gather impressions on each word's meaning (good or bad)
- Results confirmed in various experiments using Chinese ideographs, faces, and randomly shaped polygons.

**Consciousness Not Required:**
- Mere exposure effect occurs even when words or pictures are shown quickly and without awareness.

#### The Psychology of Emotional Association and Cognitive Ease

**Mere Exposure Effect:**
- System 1 responds to impressions of events unaware to System 2
- Strengthens for stimuli never consciously seen
- Biological fact that extends to all animals (Zajonc)
  * Organisms react cautiously to novel stimuli, but fades if safe
  * Survival depends on distinguishing safe from dangerous objects/habitats
  * Basis for social attachments and organization

**Creativity and Cognitive Ease:**
- Mednick's theory: Creativity = exceptional associative memory
- Remote Association Test (RAT) identifies creative associations
  * Examples: cottage -> cheese, dive -> sky
  * Not every triad has a solution

**Feeling the Solution Before Knowing It:**
- People can sense if a triad has a solution before knowing what it is
- German psychologists' findings on cognitive ease in RAT problems.

#### Mood Influence on Intuition and Cognitive Performance

**Influence of Mood on Performance: Cognitive Ease and Intuition**

**Mood's Effect on Performance:**
- Happiness enhances accuracy in intuitive tasks (double)
- Sadness impairs performance, no better than random
- Connection between good mood, intuition, creativity, gullibility
- Sadness, vigilance, suspicion form the opposite pole

**Cognitive Ease:**
- Generates a sense of ease and pleasure
- Influences judgments of coherence (linked triads)
- Smiling reaction to coherent triads
- Effect on performance: more intuitive, creative but less vigilant

**Experimental Evidence:**
1. Triad Test: sleep mail switch salt deep foam
   * Coherent triads elicit smiling response
   * Cognitive ease leads to intuitions of coherence
2. Emotional Response and Judgments of Coherence
   * Good feeling from cognitive ease is causal
   * Changes in emotional response disrupt intuition judgments
3. Cover Story Experiment: music influence on emotional reactions
   * Eliminates intuition of coherence with an alternative interpretation
4. Advancements in Understanding System 1's Automatic Workings
   * Font influences truth judgments
   * Emotional responses mediate impressions of coherence.

### 6. Norms Surprises and Causes

**System 1 and System 2 Functions**
- **System 1**: Remarkably powerful computer representing structure of our world through associative links in a vast network of ideas
- Automatic spreading of activation, but able to control memory search and programming
- Main function: Maintaining and updating personal model of the normal in your world
- Constructed by associations linking circumstances, events, actions, and outcomes that co-occur regularly
- Determines interpretation of present and expectations for future

**Assessing Normality**
- Surprise indicates how we understand and expect our world
- Two varieties of surprise: actively and passively expected events
  - Actively expected: Consciously wait for an event, surprised when it doesn't occur
  - Passively expected: Normal events in a situation, not actively waited for but not surprising when they happen
- Coincidences can change the perceived normality of an event
  - Example: Meeting the same acquaintance multiple times in different places reduces surprise due to association formation.

#### Norm Theory: The Psychology of Perception and Expectation

**Active vs. Passive Expectations**

**Passive Expectations**:
- Turn active under certain conditions
- Example: seeing a burning car in the same spot multiple times
- We become "prepared" to see another incident of the same nature

**Norm Theory**

**Altered Normality**:
- An observer notices an abnormal event (e.g., a guest wincing at soup)
- This makes other related events seem more normal
- Subsequent events are interpreted in conjunction with the original incident
- Example: another guest stifling a cry when tasting soup is now less surprising

**Cognitive Ease and Associative Coherence**:
- The "Moses illusion" is an example of associative coherence
- "Moses" and "ark" are phonetically similar, leading to unconscious acceptance of the question

#### Understanding Communication Norms: Analyzing Causes and Anomalies

**Understanding Norms in Communication**

**Norms**:
- Vast amount of world knowledge that is shared among individuals
- Provide background for detecting anomalies or abnormalities
- Specify typical/average size, range, and variability within categories

**Recognizing Incongruity**:
- Brain responds to violations of normality with astonishing speed and subtlety
- Example: "Earth revolves around the trouble every year" or "I have a large tattoo on my back" (in an upper-class voice)

**Communicating Effectively**:
- Our use of words and shared knowledge enable effective communication
- When we mention objects, we understand their typical/normal characteristics (e.g., table has a level surface with fewer than 25 legs)
- Norms provide the background for detecting anomalies

**Causality and Understanding Stories**:
- System 1 understands language and accesses norms to find causal connections in stories
- Example: "Fred's parents arrived late. The caterers were expected soon. Fred was angry."
- System 2, the conscious self, accepts the causal interpretation provided by System 1

**The Role of Norms in Communication**:
- Norms play a crucial role in understanding and constructing coherent stories
- They enable us to automatically detect causality and make sense of information presented.

#### The Illusion of Causality: Perception and Coherence

**Market Reaction to Saddam Hussein's Capture:**
- Initially, bond prices rose on capture day due to investors seeking safer assets (U.S. Treasuries)
- Headline: "U.S. TREASURIES RISE; HUSSEIN CAPTURE MAY NOT CURB TERRORISM"
- Half an hour later, bond prices fell back and headline changed to: "U.S. TREASURIES FALL; HUSSEIN CAPTURE BOOSTS ALLURE OF RISKY ASSETS"
- Both headlines provide coherent but contradictory explanations of market movements
- Automatic search for causes shapes our thinking, leading us to assume consequences have clear causes

**Associative Coherence:**
- Our brain seeks coherence and completeness in understanding events
- In the story about Jane's lost wallet:
  - Readers associate pickpocket with lost wallet more strongly than sights (even though it wasn't mentioned)
  - This is due to associative coherence, where ideas evoke explanations that fit together

**Causality and Perception:**
- Traditional view: We infer causality from repeated observations of correlated events
- Michotte argued we **see** causality directly, not just infer it based on past experiences
  - Example: A black square moving into another that starts moving in response.

#### Perception of Causality: Physical and Intentional

**Perception of Causality: Physical vs. Intentional**

**Physical Causality**:
- Observed through experiments with infants as young as 6 months old
- Infants see a cause-effect scenario, indicating surprise when sequence is altered
- Evidently ready from birth to perceive physical causality (System 1)

**Intentional Causality**:
- Demonstrated by Heider and Simmel's film "experiment"
- Viewers perceive aggressive/bullying behavior, emotions, and intentions in shapes
- Even those with autism do not escape this perception
- Inborn readiness to make intentional attributions: infants identify bullies/victims

**Separate Perception of Causality**:
- Physical causation vs. intentional causation perceived separately
- Example: Hand picking up salt is experienced as a decision made by "disembodied you"
- Many people describe their soul as the source and cause of actions

**Religious Beliefs and Evolution**:
- Bloom's claim: Inborn readiness for separate causality explains universality of religious beliefs
- Immortal souls temporarily controlling bodies and leaving them behind after death
- Shaped by evolutionary forces, building origins of religion into System 1

**Causal Intuitions and Statistical Thinking**:
- People prone to apply causal thinking inappropriately
- System 1 lacks capability for statistical reasoning
- System 2 can learn statistical thinking but few receive necessary training.

### 7. A Machine for Jumping to Conclusions

**Psychology of Causality**
- **Decision to describe psychic processes by metaphors**:
  - Based on Heider's triangles and circles as agents
  - Fits the way we think about causes
  - Easier to understand in terms of traits, intentions (System 1) and mechanical regularities (associative machine)
- **Norms and Causes**:
  - Familiar experiences often feel normal
  - Importance of considering the entire range of normal reactions
  - Need for causal stories when unlucky events occur

**Jumping to Conclusions**:
- Efficient if conclusions are likely correct and costs acceptable
- Risky when situation is unfamiliar, stakes high, or no time for more information
- Intuitive errors can be prevented by deliberate intervention of System 2

**Neglect of Ambiguity and Suppression of Doubt**:
- Exhibits in Figure 6 are ambiguous
- Read as letters in context of letters (A B C) or numbers in context of numbers (12 13 14)
- Context helps determine interpretation, which is often not aware of ambiguity

#### System 1 and System 2: Thinking in Automatic and Deliberate Modes

**System 1 vs. System 2 Thinking:**
* **Ambiguity and Interpretation**:
  + System 1 generates likely interpretations based on experience
  + Betting on an answer guided by recent context or memories
  + Unaware of alternatives or doubt
* **Believing and Unbelieving:**
  + Daniel Gilbert's theory: attempt to believe before unbelieving (System 1)
  + Automatic operation that constructs best interpretation for a situation
  + Initial belief even for nonsensical statements
* **Unbelieving as System 2 Operation:**
  + Proposed by Gilbert as contrast to System 1's automatic belief process
  + Requires mental effort to maintain incompatible interpretations
* **Experiment on Unbelieving:**
  + Participants tested on memory of "true" or "false" sentences
  + Disruption of System 2 made it difficult for people to unbelieve false statements.

#### Overcoming Cognitive Biases: The Halo Effect and Confirmation Bias

**The Gullibility of System 1**

**System 1's Role**:
- Believes almost anything when System 2 is engaged elsewhere
- Prone to confirmation bias and exaggeration of unlikely events
- Influenced by tiredness and depletion, leading to greater susceptibility to persuasive messages

**Confirmation Bias**:
- People seek data compatible with their existing beliefs (positive test strategy)
- Favors uncritical acceptance and overestimation of extreme or improbable events

**The Halo Effect**:
- When we like/dislike someone, we tend to extend that feeling to other aspects of their character
- The name "halo effect" refers to the tendency for positive traits (such as friendliness) to influence our perceptions of a person's other characteristics
- This bias simplifies and makes the representation of the world generated by System 1 more coherent than reality.

#### The Halo Effect: Influence of First Impressions on Perception and Decision Making

**The Halo Effect**

**Description**:
- Phenomenon where initial impressions influence perception of subsequent traits
- Example: Alan vs Ben

**Impact on Perception**:
- Initial traits shape meaning of later traits
- Stubbornness in an intelligent person seen as justified, respectable
- Same traits in envious, critical person perceived negatively

**Variations on Research Theme**:
- Participants asked to judge plausibility of all adjectives describing one person
- Sequence in which characteristics observed determined by chance

**Halo Effect and Grading**:
- Professor grading essay exams noticed homogeneous evaluations
- First essay had disproportionate impact on final grade
- Adopted new procedure: score each question separately to avoid bias

#### Halo Effect and Decorrelation of Errors in Judgment

**Observations on Grading Methods:**

**Shift to New Procedure**:
- Confidence in grading was lower than before
- Experienced discomfort when grading student's second essay after giving them a top grade on the first
- Tempted to change grades and find it hard to follow rule of not yielding to temptation
- Grades for a single student varied over a considerable range

**Realizing the Issue**:
- Recognized that earlier consistency was spurious, produced feeling of cognitive ease
- Allowed influence of first question on grading of subsequent questions to avoid dissonance
- Uncomfortable inconsistency revealed when switched to new procedure

**Principle of Decorrelating Errors**:
- Aggregation of individual judgments tends to be accurate when errors are uncorrelated
- Shared bias reduces the effectiveness of error reduction through aggregation
- Importance of maintaining independence between sources of evidence

**Police Procedure**:
- Preventing witnesses from discussing event before giving testimony
- Allows for unbiased testimonies and reduces potential influence on each other.

#### "Cognitive Biases and Decision Making: The Primacy of First Impressions"

**Mental Processes: Eliminating Redundancy and Avoiding Wysiati**

**Eliminating Redundancy:**
- Independent judgments reduce redundancy
- In meetings, have all members write a brief summary of their position before discussion
- This utilizes diverse knowledge and opinions in the group
- Open discussion often favors those who speak first and assertively

**The Principle of Independent Judgments:**
- Represents the value of diversity in thinking
- Prevents groupthink and ensures thorough consideration of issues

**Wysiati (What You See Is All There Is):**
- Our minds represent only activated ideas
- Information not retrieved may as well not exist
- System 1 excels at constructing coherent stories from current information
- Jumps to conclusions when data is scarce

**System 1 and System 2:**
- System 1: Intuitive beliefs, based on impressions generated
- System 2: More systematic approach, follows a list of checks before making decisions
- System 1 influences even the more careful decisions made by System 2.

#### The Power of Cognitive Ease: How Simplicity Shapes Our Perception and Decisions

**WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is) Effect:**
* System 1's insensitivity to information quality and quantity leads to:
  * Jumping to conclusions based on limited evidence
  * Misunderstandings and biases in judgment and choice

**Study Findings:**
- Exposure to one-sided evidence affects judgments:
  * Participants who saw only one side were more confident, even if they knew it was biased
  * Coherence of story determines confidence, not the completeness of information
- WYSIATI facilitates achieving coherence and cognitive ease
- Overconfidence in beliefs due to limited evidence and lack of consideration for missing critical information
- Framing effects influence emotions and judgments based on how information is presented.

**Implications:**
* Importance of considering multiple perspectives before making decisions
* Acknowledging potential biases in judgment caused by WYSIATI effect
* Being aware that confidence does not necessarily equate to accurate or complete understanding.

### 8. How Judgments Happen

**Impact of First Impressions:**
* Individuals often form strong opinions based on initial descriptions (halo effect)
* Salient information overshadows statistical facts or base rates
* Examples: "10% fat vs attractive", Steve the librarian stereotype

**Base Rate Neglect:**
* Overlooking statistical probabilities in favor of vivid descriptions
* Instances of base rate neglect: assumptions about individuals based on limited info, ignoring potential for more information

**Judgment Formation:**
* Two systems responsible for answering questions and making judgments: System 1 (automatic) and System 2 (directed attention)
* System 1 assesses basic aspects of situation without effort
* Substitution of one judgment for another due to ease or automaticity
* System 1 shaped by evolution for survival, providing continuous assessment of threats/opportunities.

#### Rapid Face Judgment and Its Influence on Voting Decisions

**Threat Assessment and Social Interaction:**
- Human brain inherited neural mechanisms for threat evaluation
- Constant assessment of safety or danger
- Good mood and cognitive ease indicate feeling safe
- Ability to discriminate friend from foe contributes to survival

**Facial Expressions and Assessments:**
- Rapid judgments of dominance and trustworthiness based on faces
  - Dominant = potential threat, square chin
  - Trustworthy = friendly intentions, facial expression (smile)
- Influence on modern world: voting decisions
- Studies show correlation between face ratings and election outcomes
- Facial features not predictors of political performance

**The Role of Face Reading:**
- Ancient mechanism for assessing strangers
- Survival advantage in dangerous world
- Influences modern voting decisions

**Todorov's Research:**
- Study on human ability to evaluate strangers based on facial features
  - Shown pictures of men's faces, asked observers to rate attributes
- High agreement among observers on ratings
- Results applied to election outcomes: significant correlation between competence ratings and winning candidates
- Competence assessed through combination of strength and trustworthiness.

#### The Influence of System 1 on Political Decisions and Perception

**Brain's Response to Winning and Losing Candidates:**
- **Judgment Heuristic**: We are biologically predisposed to reject candidates lacking valued attributes (negative emotional response)
- Voters use a simpler, automatic assessment of candidate competence for quick decision making
- Studies show stronger emotional response towards losers compared to winners
- Political scientists identified uninformed voters as those with significant impact from System 1 preferences
- System 1 plays a larger role in voting choices for information-poor and TV-prone individuals

**Understanding Language:**
- System 1 understands language and performs basic assessments during perception of events and message comprehension
- Assessments include: similarity, representativeness, causality, evaluations of associations/exemplars
- Not every possible attribute is assessed (e.g., height of tower in figure 7)
- System 2 required for specific tasks like counting blocks to determine equality.

**Impressions and Judgments:**
- Immediate impression of the display in figure 7: towers are equal height, similar, more similar to each other than left tower is to middle array
- Accurate judgment of average length of lines in figure 8 without impairment from cognitive tasks.

#### The Limitations and Abilities of System 1 for Estimation Tasks

**System 1 vs. System 2:**
- **System 1**: automatically registers and processes basic information, such as color, parallelism of lines, number of objects (up to four)
- **System 2**: activated for more complex calculations like estimating total length of lines or dealing with sums

**Limitations of System 1:**
- Ignorance of quantity in emotional contexts
- Poor handling of sums and average estimation

**Experiment on saving birds:**
- Participants' willingness to pay for nets showed no significant difference based on number of birds saved
- Underlying intensity or amount is the deciding factor, not the quantity itself

**Intensity Matching:**
- Questions about happiness, popularity, punishment, and political prospects refer to an underlying dimension of intensity
- Allows matching across diverse dimensions (crimes as colors, music)
- System 1 can perform intensity matching for various dimensions.

#### The Mental Shotgun: Excessive Computations and Inaccurate Judgments

**Experiments on Perception and Judgment**
* People adjusted loudness of sound based on crime severity or punishment
* Sense of injustice if tones are not proportional
* Example: Julie's reading ability at age four
	+ Height comparison: 6ft too little, 7ft probably too much
	+ Fairly remarkable but not extraordinary
	+ Reading at 15 months is extraordinary
* Predicting Julie's GPA using matching scale
	+ People translate from one scale to another
	+ Naturally wrong but acceptable for System 1 and most people

**The Mental Shotgun**
* System 1: carries out multiple computations at once
	+ Routine assessments: continuous representation of surroundings
	+ Occasional judgments: voluntary and triggered by intention
* Control over intended computations is imprecise
	+ Excess computation, the mental shotgun
* Experiments on rhyming words
	+ Participants listened to word pairs and pressed keys for rhymes
	+ VOTE--GOAT: rhyme but not spelled identically
	+ Slower response due to comparison of spelling
* Intention to answer one question evoked another, unnecessary computation.

**Experiments on Literally True or False Sentences**
* People pressed keys for true or false answers based on sentences
* Some roads are snakes: literally false
* Some jobs are snakes: metaphorically true and difficult
* Participants took longer to respond to the following sentences due to the potential for metaphorical meaning.

### 9. Answering an Easier Question

**Mental Processes for Generating Intuitive Opinions**

**Substitution**:
- When a satisfactory answer to a hard question is not found quickly, System 1 finds a related, easier question and answers that instead
- This process of answering one question in place of another is called **substitution**

**Terminology**:
- **Target Question**: The assessment you intend to produce
- **Heuristic Question**: The simpler question that you answer instead
- **Heuristic**: A simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions

**Background**:
- Substitution is a strategy for solving difficult problems, as George Pólya's "How to Solve It" suggests
- This approach was the core of the heuristics and biases approach in understanding how people judge probability without knowing precisely what it is
- System 1 often makes this substitution move when faced with difficult target questions, if an answer to a related and easier heuristic question readily comes to mind.

#### Heuristics for Quick Answers: Mental Shotgun and Intensity Matching

**Heuristics vs. Careful Reasoning:**
- **Mental shotgun**: imprecise control over responses to questions
- Difficult questions require dealing with other complex issues
- Heuristic alternative: quick answers without much effort

**Table 1: Target vs. Heuristic Questions**
| **Heuristic Question** | **Target Question** |
| --- | --- |
| How much would you contribute to save an endangered species? | What is the meaning of happiness? |
| How much emotion do I feel when I think of dying dolphins? | What are the likely political developments in the next six months? |
| How happy are you with your life these days? | What are the standard sentences for other financial crimes? |
| What is my mood right now? | How strong is the competition that the candidate faces? |
| How popular is the president right now? | What other environmental or other causes should be considered? |
| How should financial advisers who prey on the elderly be punished? | How much anger do I feel when I think of financial predators? |
| How far will she go in politics? | Does this woman look like a political winner? |
| **Does this woman look like a political winner?** | How should you judge someone's political abilities? |
|  | What are the expectations for her future political success? |

**Intensity Matching:**
- Both feelings and dollar amounts are intensity scales
- Heuristic questions provide answers that can be matched to target question intensity
- Example: Feeling about dolphins matches contribution dollars.

#### Three-Dimensional Perception Illusions and their Impact on Judgment

**The Process of Substitution and Heuristics:**
- **Substitution**: when System 2 endorses an intuitive answer without proper scrutiny, often due to a "path of least effort"
- **Illustration of Substitution through a Perceptual Illusion**:
  - Figure on the right appears larger than figure on left in 3D perspective drawing (despite being identical sizes)
  - Impression of size dominated by 3-D interpretation of scene, overriding accurate judgment for 2-D size
  - This occurs due to a 3-D heuristic: an automatic assumption that larger objects are further away
  - The illusion is not a misunderstanding but a bias in perception caused by this heuristic.
- **The Mood Heuristic for Happiness**:
  - Example of substitution from a survey of German students:
    - Participants were asked to judge their mood based on smiling pictures of strangers
    - Those who saw a picture of a person with a wide smile tended to report being in a better mood, even if the photo showed nothing but a toothy grin
  - The "wide smile" cue triggered a positive emotional state (mood heuristic) that influenced the judgment, overriding accurate assessment.
- **Consequences of Substitution**:
  - Judgments based on substitution are biased and predictable
  - Occurs automatically due to powerful heuristics in our perceptual system
  - Difficult for individuals to ignore or correct, as they often occur at a deeper level of perception.

#### Correlation of Happiness and Dating: Affect Heuristic Example

**Study Findings on Happiness and Dating:**
* Students' happiness level and number of dates had zero correlation when asked about both in sequence
* When order was reversed, strong correlation between reported happiness and number of dates
* Explanation: Substitution effect
	+ Students thought about romantic life for the previous question and carried over emotion to general happiness assessment
* Natural assessment of overall happiness requires thought and consideration
* Students do not confuse concepts but use System 1's ready answer for emotionally significant questions.

**Impact of Emotions on Beliefs:**
* Paul Slovic's affect heuristic: people let emotions determine beliefs about the world
* Conclusions often dominate arguments, especially when emotions are involved.

#### "The Bias of System 2: Emotions and Belief Formation"

**System 1: Intuitive and Emotional Processing**
- Determines political preferences and emotional attitudes towards various topics (health policy, foreign relations)
- Beliefs influenced by existing emotions rather than logical analysis or information seeking (open to some change with new data)
- Primacy of conclusions: opinions largely unchanged despite new information
- Emotional attitude impacts perception of risks and benefits
- Can be influenced by heuristics and substitution of easier questions

**Characteristics of System 1:**
- Automatic, fast processing
- Intuitive and emotional
- Influences hunches about behavior under different circumstances.

### 10. The Law of Small Numbers

**System 1 and System 2 Processes**
* **System 1**: generates impressions, feelings, and inclinations; operates automatically and quickly
* **System 2**: mobilizes attention when a particular pattern is detected (search), executes skilled responses and generates intuitions after adequate training
* When endorsed by System 2, patterns become beliefs, attitudes, and intentions
* Distinguishes surprising from normal, infers causes and intentions, neglects ambiguity, and frames decision problems narrowly
* Responds more strongly to losses than gains (loss aversion)

**Heuristics and Biases**
* System 1's limited set of basic assessments: creates coherent pattern of activated ideas in associative memory, matches intensities across scales, sometimes substitutes easier questions for difficult ones
* Overweights low probabilities and shows diminishing sensitivity to quantity (psychophysics)
* Computes more than intended (mental shortcut), framed decision problems narrowly in isolation from one another

**The Law of Small Numbers**
* Study on kidney cancer incidence in US counties:
  + Counties with lowest incidence are mostly rural, sparsely populated, located in Republican states
  + County characteristics cannot directly explain both high and low incidence rates
* System 2's deliberate search and hypothesis formulation, influenced by facts retrieved from associative memory.

#### Statistical Explanation for Geographic Cancer Variance

**Key Factor:**
- Rural counties have small populations, not the main issue

**Mind and Statistics:**
- System 1 identifies causal connections between events
- But struggles with "merely statistical" facts
- Random events do not lend themselves to explanation
- Collections of random events exhibit regular behavior

**Sampling Example:**
- Large urn filled with marbles, half red and half white
- Repeated sampling of 4 or 7 marbles per trial
- More extreme outcomes (all red/white) in small samples
- Statistical fact: expected percentages differ between sample sizes

**Cancer Rates:**
- Population as marbles in a giant urn
- Extreme outcomes more likely in sparsely populated counties
- Explained by the smaller sample size in rural areas

**Conclusion:**
- Incidence of kidney cancer varies systematically across counties
- Explanation: statistical phenomenon of extreme outcomes in small samples.

#### Intuitive Statistics: A Matter of Scale and Precision

**Understanding Sampling Effects**

**Background:**
- Incidence of cancer not truly lower or higher in small populations, just appears so due to sampling effect
- Small samples yield extreme results more frequently than large ones

**Implications**:
- Results from large samples are more precise than small samples
- Small samples can be misleading and lead to incorrect conclusions

**Intuitive Understanding**:
- Previous knowledge that larger samples are more trustworthy
- Realization that intuitive understanding of sampling effects may be limited or incomplete

**History of Research:**
- Early collaboration between Amos and the author in the 1970s
- Disagreement on the ability of non-statisticians to intuitively understand statistics
- Personal experience of having poor intuition for sampling variation

**Significance**:
- Sampling variation is a nuisance in research projects, making conclusions uncertain.

#### The Bias of Statistical Intuition in Psychological Research

**Researcher Challenges:**
- **Wasted time and effort**: failing to confirm a hypothesis that was true
- **Sampling size** determines risk of error
  - Researchers often choose too small samples
  - Leaves them at the mercy of sampling luck
- Traditional methods for deciding sample size are flawed
  - Common intuitive misconceptions about sampling variation

**Mistakes in Research:**
- Prevalent issue among psychologists
- Odd results can be artifacts of small samples
- Researchers often choose samples that expose them to a 50% risk of failing to confirm true hypotheses
- Previous researcher's own experience: taught statistics and made similar mistakes

**Exploring the Issue:**
- Amos Tuzikov visited seminar and discussed the issue
- Decided to examine whether researchers with mathematical expertise would make similar mistakes
- Developed a questionnaire to assess sample size choices, risks, and advice for hypothetical students

**Findings:**
- Participants, including statistical textbook authors, made similar mistakes
  - Belief in the "Law of Small Numbers"
    - Intuitions about random sampling satisfy this law despite being incorrect

**Recommendations:**
- Regard statistical intuitions with suspicion
- Replace impression formation by computation whenever possible

#### Bias Towards Certainty: System 1 and the Law of Small Numbers

**Understanding the Message: Elderly Support President Poll**

**Key Points:**
- The message can be summarized as "elderly support president"
- Details about poll size (300 respondents) are background information, not crucial to understanding the story
- People are generally insensitive to sample size in polls
- Reliability of results matters: a flawed or biased poll will be discredited
- System 1 suppresses doubt and constructs coherent stories, favoring certainty over doubt
- The law of small numbers is related to our tendency to exaggerate consistency and coherence in what we see

**Associative Machinery and Causes:**
- Seeks causes
- Can lead to jumping to conclusions based on limited evidence
- Produces a representation of reality that may be too consistent or coherent.

#### Misconceptions of Randomness in Statistical Analysis

**The Difficulty of Understanding Statistical Regularities**

**Randomness**:
- Chance selects events from alternatives, not caused by specific causes
- Counterintuitive that all possible sequences of random events are equally likely

**Counterintuitive Examples**:
- Sequences of six births (e.g., BBBGGG, GGGGGG, BGBBGB) are equally likely due to independence and equal likelihood of outcomes
- Intuitively, BGBBGB is considered more likely as it appears random

**Pattern Seeking and Causal Thinking**:
- We have an innate tendency to seek patterns and reject the idea of true randomness
- This bias has evolutionary advantages in detecting changes in the environment

**Consequences of Misunderstanding Randomness**:
- Significant consequences can arise from this misunderstanding
- For example, during World War II, a statistical analysis revealed that the distribution of bombing hits was typical of a random process, despite appearances to the contrary.

#### Illusion of Patterns and Causality: A Study on Hot Hand in Basketball

**The Yom Kippur War**
- Broke out in 1973
- Israeli Air Force (IAF) investigated why one squadron suffered significant losses while another did not
- Investigation found no operational differences, but lives of pilots differed in many ways
	+ Frequency of returning home between missions
	+ Conduct of debriefings
- **Advice**: Accept that outcomes were due to blind luck, stop interviewing pilots

**Misperceptions of Randomness in Basketball**
- Study by Amos, Tom Gilovich, and Robert Vallone
- Findings:
	+ There is no "hot hand" effect in professional basketball shooting or foul shot scoring
	+ Sequences of shots satisfy all tests of randomness
	+ Perception of pattern in randomness is overwhelming
- **Reaction**:
	+ Disbelief in the public response
	+ Coach Red Auerbach's dismissive attitude: "Who is this guy? So he makes a study. I couldn't care less."

**Implications**
- Illusion of pattern affects our lives in many ways off the basketball court.

#### Overestimating Skill: The Fallacy of Causal Attribution in Education

**Misclassifying Random Events as Systematic:**
* Erroneously concluding that an investment adviser or CEO has unusual skill based on a single event or success
* Intuition often leads to misclassification of random events
* We are prone to reject belief in randomness

**Successful Schools and Educational Research:**
* Small schools believed to provide superior education due to personal attention and encouragement
* Gates Foundation, Annenberg Foundation, Pew Charitable Trust, and US Department of Education invested in creating small schools
* Causal story seems plausible, but the facts are incorrect

**Flaws in Educational Research:**
* Researchers have sought successful school characteristics to improve education
* Small schools found to be more effective due to personal attention and encouragement
* However, this conclusion is based on misinterpreted data

**Misinterpreting Data on School Size and Performance:**
* If researchers had looked at worst-performing schools instead, they would have found an overrepresentation of small schools
* Small schools can also produce low achievements if students face challenges beyond personal attention and encouragement
* Correlation does not imply causation.

### 11. Anchors

**The Law of Small Numbers and Anchoring Effects**

**Small Schools vs. Large Schools**:
- Small schools are not better on average, they are just more variable
- Large schools tend to produce better results, especially in higher grades

**Cognitive Psychology Insights**:
- The "law of small numbers" is part of two larger stories about the workings of the mind
- Exaggerated faith in small samples is an example of a wider illusion
- We pay more attention to message content than reliability, leading to a simplified view of the world

**Caution with Statistics**:
- Many observed facts appear to beg for causal explanations but do not lend themselves to such explanations
- Chance events should not be explained causally, as these explanations are inevitably wrong

**Anchoring Effects**:
- Experiment: Participants overestimated the percentage of African nations in the UN based on a rigged wheel of fortune
- This is an example of the anchoring effect - estimating values is influenced by an initial anchor value

#### Anchoring Effects in Cognitive Adjustments

**Anchoring Effects in Estimation:**
* Anchoring effect: psychological phenomenon where a number (anchor) influences estimates of an uncertain quantity
* First demonstrated by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in a 1974 experiment published in Science
* Effect observed when estimating various uncertain quantities, such as age or house value
* Can lead to inconsistent judgments due to different anchoring points

**Anchoring Effect Mechanisms:**
* Deliberate process of adjustment (System 2):
	+ Start with an anchoring number
	+ Assess whether it is too high or low
	+ Gradually adjust estimate by mentally "moving" from the anchor
	+ Prematurely ends when no longer certain of further movement
* Automatic manifestation of System 1: priming effect
* Both mechanisms contribute to anchoring effects in estimation.

#### Anchoring: Deliberate and Conscious Adjustment Effect

**Insufficient Adjustment**
* Explains why we may not adjust properly when transitioning from high-stress situations to calmer environments (e.g., driving fast after getting off the highway, teenagers playing loud music in their rooms)
* Results from a failure of System 2, which is responsible for deliberate and conscious adjustments

**Effects of Insufficient Adjustment:**
- Deliberately driving or behaving unsafely (driving too fast)
- Misunderstandings between individuals with different preferences (loud music)

**Anchoring Effect**
* Anchoring occurs when a starting point (anchor) influences our estimates or judgments
* Can result in insufficient adjustment, leading to biased estimates

**Forms of Anchoring:**
1. Deliberate and conscious adjustment:
   * Occurs when we are aware of the anchor and make an effort to move away from it (e.g., George Washington becoming president)
   * Involves System 2, which requires mental resources

2. Priming effect:
   * Anchoring that occurs without a subjective experience or conscious awareness (e.g., absurdly high numbers affecting estimates)
   * Results from the suggestion of an external stimulus on our thoughts and behaviors.

#### Understanding the Psychology Behind Anchoring Effects: Suggestion as Priming for Compatible Evidence

**Anchoring Effects:**
* Amos and I had disagreements about anchoring effects
* Conservatism vs. liberal views on hunches
* Suggestion not the sole cause of anchoring
* Experiments inconclusive, gave up writing about it
* Two types of anchoring: suggestion and associative coherence

**Anchoring Effects: Suggestion as Priming Effect:**
* System 1 understands sentences by trying to make them true
* Selective activation of compatible thoughts produces systematic errors
* Gandhi living for 144 years is an example of ancient impression
* Mussweiler and Strack's demonstration of associative coherence in anchoring:
  * High anchor (68°F): easier to recognize summer words
  * Low anchor (40°F): easier to recognize winter words
* High and low numbers activate different sets of ideas, biasing estimates

**Anchoring Effects: Suggestion and Anchoring as Priming Effects:**
* Both explained by automatic operation of System 1
* Link between anchoring and suggestion proven correct.

**The Anchoring Index:**
* Measurable psychological phenomenon
* Impressively large effect in anchoring experiments.

#### Anchoring Effects in Decision-Making and Contribution Levels

**Anchoring Effect Experiment:**
- **Two questions asked at San Francisco Exploratorium**: Is the height of the tallest redwood more or less than 1,200 feet? What is your best guess about the height of the tallest redwood?
- **High anchor**: 1,200 feet for some participants; low anchor: 180 feet for others
- **Difference between anchors**: 1,020 feet
- **Results**: Two groups produced very different mean estimates: 844 and 282 feet (difference = 562 feet)
- **Anchoring index**: Ratio of the differences expressed as a percentage (562/1,020 = 55%)
- Anchoring effect can be strong in real life:
  - Experiment with real estate agents and a house on the market
    * Half saw high asking price, other half saw low asking price
    * Agents denied influence of listing price but it affected their judgments (anchoring effect = 41%)
- **Professionals** vs. **students**: Similar susceptibility to anchoring effects (55% vs. 48%)
- Anchoring effect in decisions about money: How much to contribute to save seabirds from oil spills.

#### The Power of Anchoring: Influencing Decision-Making and Estimations

**Anchoring Effects in Psychology:**

**Introduction**:
- Anchoring effect observed in various studies on estimates and willingness to pay
- Can be significant, influencing people's responses even with random anchors

**Examples of Anchoring Effects**:
- Visitors at The Exploratorium:
  - Average willingness to pay was $64 without an anchor
  - With a $5 anchor, average willingness to pay was $20
  - With a $400 anchor, average willingness to pay was $143
- Large anchoring effect observed in Marseilles study (50%)
- Observed in online trading and fine art auctions

**Rationale for Anchoring Effects**:
- People may clutch at straws when faced with difficult questions
- Anchor can be a plausible hint, especially when the respondent lacks knowledge

**Random Anchors**:
- Can be just as effective as informative anchors
- Demonstrated in experiments using Social Security numbers

**Implications and Limitations**:
- Anchors do not have their effects because people believe they are informative
- German judges' study showed that even experienced judges were influenced by loaded dice rolls (3 or 9) when setting prison sentences for shoplifters.

#### Anchoring Bias in Negotiations and Decision-Making

**Anchoring Effects**

**Understanding Anchors**:
- Anchoring effects are everywhere due to priming or insufficient adjustment
- Explained by psychological mechanisms that make us suggestible
- Arbitrary rationing in marketing is an example of anchoring effect
    - Limiting the number of items bought increases purchases
    - Mention of a limit creates anchoring even if it's random

**Anchors in Negotiations**:
- Initial anchor sets the price in single-issue negotiations
- First mover has advantage due to anchoring effect
- Making a scene can negate the effect of an outrageous anchor

**Resisting Anchoring Effects**:
- Focusing attention and searching memory for arguments against anchor
- Thinking the opposite can help resist anchoring effects

**Anchors in Public Policy**:
- Capping awards in personal injury cases may benefit serious offenders more
- Exposure to random or absurd anchors influences System 2's judgments

**The Two Systems**:
- Anchoring effects occur when System 1 retrieves information for System 2
- Unreliable or irrelevant anchors still bias the associative system

### 12. The Science of Availability

**Anchoring Effects:**
* Result of associative activation from stories or news reports
* Can influence thoughts and behavior without awareness
* Extreme case: random anchors provide no information yet guide thinking
* Influences judgment, decision making, intuitive prediction
* Affects high stakes situations
* Counteracting anchoring effect requires mobilizing System 2

**Quotes:**
* "The firm we want to acquire sent us their business plan, with the revenue they expect. We shouldn't let it influence our thinking."
* "Plans are best-case scenarios. Let's avoid anchoring on plans when forecasting actual outcomes."
* "Our aim in negotiation is to get them anchored on this number."
* "The defendant's lawyers put in a frivolous reference, which anchored the judge on a ridiculously low amount of damages."

**Productive Year (1971-1972):**
* Spent in Eugene, Oregon at Oregon Research Institute
* Hosted by Paul Slovic and his wife Roz
* Productive collaboration with Amos Tversky
* Conducted experiments on judgment heuristics
* Wrote articles on intuitive prediction and decision making
* Worked hard alongside normal life activities in Eugene.

#### The Availability Heuristic: Judging Frequency by Ease of Recall

**Availability Heuristic**

**Projects in that year:**
- Study of availability heuristic

**Definition:**
- Process used to judge frequency based on ease of retrieving instances from memory

**Early findings:**
- Two systems involved: deliberate problem-solving strategy and automatic operation
- No specific number of instances needed for impression of ease
- Substitution of questions leads to biases

**Factors affecting availability:**
- Salient events that attract attention
  * Divorces among Hollywood celebrities, political sex scandals: easy retrieval = exaggerated frequency
- Dramatic events temporarily increase category availability
  * Plane crash: alter feelings about safety of flying
- Personal experiences, pictures, vivid examples more available than incidents that happened to others or mere statistics
- Judicial errors impact personal faith in justice system more than general incidents

**Examples:**
- Ease of retrieving instances of 'dangerous plants' or 'people who divorce after the age of 60'
- Immediate knowledge about relative frequency of countries appearing in news.

#### Understanding Availability Bias and its Impact on Self-Assessment

**Biases in Perception:**

**Maintaining Vigilance Against Availability Biases:**
- Effort required to reconsider impressions and intuitions
- Ask questions to challenge biases: "Is my belief based on recent instances or general assumption?"

**Marital Conflicts and Self-Estimated Contributions:**
- Spouses overestimate their own contributions in marital projects
- Explanation: Availability bias, clear memory of individual efforts vs. others' contributions
- Not necessarily self-serving: overestimation of personal contribution to causing quarrels as well

**Debiasing Opportunities:**
- Circumstances of credit allocation easy to identify
- Observation that there is usually more than 100% credit to go around can defuse situation

**Understanding Availability Heuristic:**
- Major advance in understanding availability bias in early 1990s
- Question: How do people's impressions of frequency change when required to list instances?
- Experiment: Listing instances affects perception of own assertiveness, difficulty level determines perceived self-worth.

#### The Influence of Availability Bias on Self-Perception and Judgment

**Impact of Listing Instances on Self-Ratings:**

**Observations**:
- Retrieving instances can enhance judgments of personality traits through two routes: number of instances retrieved and ease of retrieval.
- The contest between these determinants yields a clear winner: ease of retrieval dominates the self-ratings.

**Experiments**:
1. Schwarz's study: participants who listed twelve instances of assertive behavior rated themselves as less assertive than those who only listed six.
2. Participants asked to list non-assertive behaviors saw themselves as quite assertive despite struggling to find examples.
3. Fluent retrieval of instances influenced self-ratings more than the actual number retrieved.
4. Facial expression study: people who contracted the zygomaticus muscle (smiling) found it easier to come up with examples and rated themselves as more assertive compared to those who furrowed their brows (frowning).
5. Frowners had difficulty retrieving instances and rated themselves as relatively lacking in assertiveness.

**Additional Findings**:
1. People:
   - Believe they use their bicycles less often after recalling many rather than few instances
   - Are less confident when asked to produce more arguments for a choice
   - Are less confident that an event was avoidable after listing more ways it could have been avoided
2. A UCLA professor's study: students who listed more ways to improve the course rated it higher.
3. Paradoxical results are not always found, as people can be influenced by both content and ease of retrieval.

#### Judgment by Availability: An Unexpected Unavailability Heuristic

**Schwarz's Experiment on Assertiveness:**
- Participants struggle to recall assertiveness instances: fluency decreases unexpectedly
- This surprise influences judgment of assertiveness level
- Schwarz aims to disrupt this effect by providing explanations for retrieval difficulties
- Results show that explained fluency no longer impacts self-perception of assertiveness

**Process Involved in Judgment by Availability:**
1. Diminishing fluency experienced as instances are recalled
2. Expectations about rate of decreasing fluency are incorrect
3. Unexpected low fluency causes self-described unassertiveness when recalling 12 instances instead of 6
4. Eliminating surprise eliminates the influence of low fluency on judgment

**System 1 and Judgment Process:**
- System 1 capable of setting expectations and being surprised
- Recent surprises serve as possible causes of current retrieval problems
- Expectations can be reset by System 2, making an event less surprising

**Personal Involvement in Judgment:**
- People involved personally are more likely to consider memory retrieval instances
- Less reliance on fluency for judgment when assessing assertiveness.

### 13. Availability Emotion and Risk

**Effects of Family History on Cardiac Health Perception:**
* Students with family history more engaged in evaluating risk: easier to retrieve instances of safe or risky behaviors -> stronger effect on feelings of safety or danger
* Three groups based on family history: those with heart disease, those without, and those uncertain
* Those with no family history: casual about the task, follow availability heuristic
* Those with a family history: opposite pattern - safer when many instances of safe behaviors, greater danger with risky ones
* Effects of ease of retrieval stronger in people who score high on faith in intuition or knowledgeable novices

**Factors Influencing Susceptibility to Availability Biases:**
* Engaged in another task at the same time: less vigilant, more affected by ease of retrieval
* Good mood: positive emotions increase trust in intuition
* High score on depression scale: lower mood decreases trust in intuition
* Knowledgeable novices vs true experts: experts have better understanding and judgement
* Low faith in intuition: less susceptible to availability biases
* Powerful individuals: increased trust in their own intuition

**Impact of Availability on Risk Perception:**
* People's feelings, moods, or experiences can influence the ease with which instances come to mind, affecting risk perception.

**Examples of Availability Effects:**
* Fear of plane crashes after recent incidents: availability bias
* Underestimation of indoor pollution risks due to lack of media stories: availability effect
* Perception of conspiracies after watching spy movies: availability bias
* Overconfidence in CEOs after several successes in a row: availability effect.

#### Media's Impact on Perception of Risk: Availability Bias in Disaster Awareness

**Impact of Disasters and Public Perception:**
* Californians take protective measures after disasters but eventually become complacent
* Memory fades over time
* Cycles of disaster, concern, and growing complacency
* Individuals and governments design actions based on past experiences
* Societies prepare for potential disasters according to historical high-water marks
* Availability bias: judgment influenced by media coverage and emotional intensity

**Studies on Public Perceptions of Risks:**
* Conducted by Slovic, Lichtenstein, and Fischhoff in Eugene
* Research focused on public judgments of causes of death
* Participants estimated relative frequencies based on pairs of causes
* Results contrasted with health statistics

**Findings from the Survey:**
* Strokes cause twice as many deaths as all accidents combined but are considered less frequent
* Tornadoes perceived as more frequent than asthma despite being 20 times less deadly
* Lightning seen as less likely than botulism, despite being 52 times more frequent
* Death by disease is 18 times more common than accidental death but judged equally likely
* Accidents judged to be over 300 times more likely than diabetes, while the true ratio is 1:4

**Impact of Media Coverage:**
* Media coverage shapes public interest and editors' decisions
* Unusual events receive disproportionate attention
* Perception of frequency distorted by media exposure.

#### Emotions and Decision Making: The Affect Heuristic

**Associative Memory and Affect Heuristic**

**Estimates of Causes of Death**:
- Represent activation of ideas in associative memory
- Example of substitution: ease of thinking about risks + emotional reactions = fear

**Affect Heuristic**:
- People make judgments/decisions by consulting emotions:
  - Do I like it? Hate it? How strongly do I feel about it?
- Affect heuristic is an instance of substitution:
  - Easy question (How do I feel?) serves as answer to harder one (What do I think?)

**Damasio's Work**:
- Emotional evaluations, bodily states, and approach/avoidance tendencies guide decision making
- People with brain damage may lack emotional responses and struggle to make good decisions
- Impaired "healthy fear" of bad consequences is a significant flaw

**Affect Heuristic Demonstration**:
- Surveying opinions on various technologies: benefits, risks
- Reading messages about technology's benefits or low risks changed emotional appeal
- People changed beliefs about technology's risks based on emotional response, without evidence

**Implications**:
- The **emotional tail wags the rational dog**
- Affect heuristic simplifies life by creating an "imaginary world" with fewer tradeoffs between benefits and costs

#### The Perception of Risk: Experts vs Public Values

**Paul Slovic's Perspective on Human Judgment of Risk:**

**Slovic's Critique of the Public**:
- Emotionally guided rather than reasoned
- Easily swayed by trivial details
- Inadequate sensitivity to low vs. negligible probabilities

**Study of Experts**:
- Superior in dealing with numbers and amounts
- Biases in lay judgments, but also differences in values
- Experts often measure risks by number of lives lost, while public considers distinctions like "good deaths" vs. "bad deaths"

**Slovic's Argument**:
- Public has richer conception of risks than experts
- Resists idea that experts should rule and their opinions should be accepted without question when they conflict with the public
- When experts and public disagree, each side must respect the insights and intelligence of the other

**Challenge to Experts' Expertise**:
- The concept of "risk" is not objective, but invented by humans to understand and cope with dangers
- Defining risk depends on the choice of a measure, which may be guided by preferences for certain outcomes
- "Defining risk is thus an exercise in power"

**Implications**:
- Policy questions involve assumptions about human nature and choices
- Every policy decision ultimately affects people and their wellbeing.

#### "The Availability Cascade: Irrational Risk Perception in Mass Media"

**Cass Sunstein's Perspective on Risk Regulation:**
* Disagrees with Slovic about experts vs citizens
* Believes in role of experts as bulwark against "populist" excesses
* Trusts objectivity achieved through science, expertise, and deliberation
* Argues biased reactions to risks lead to erratic priorities in public policy
* Coined term "availability cascade" for mechanism of bias influence on policy:
  * Starts with media report of a minor event
  * Leads to public panic and large-scale government action
  * Cycle perpetuated by availability entrepreneurs seeking attention
  * Scientists who challenge overstatement attract hostility, often accused of cover-up.

**Sunstein's Beliefs on Risk Regulation:**
* Regulation should be based on rational weighting of costs and benefits
* Number of lives saved or life-years as objective measurement units
* Biased reactions to risks cause erratic priorities in public policy
* Government intervention can be wasteful of lives and money if driven by emotional reactions.

**The Availability Cascade:**
* Mechanism for biases to flow into policy decisions
* Starts with media report of a minor event
* Leads to public panic, government action, and intensified media coverage
* Cycle perpetuated by availability entrepreneurs seeking attention and headlines
* Scientists challenging overstatements face hostility and accusations of cover-up.

#### Availability Cascade: Love Canal and Alar Scare as Pseudo-Events

**The Availability Cascade and Controversial Environmental Issues**

**Love Canal Affair**:
- Buried toxic waste exposed during a rainy season in 1979, causing contamination of water and foul smell
- Lois Gibbs and others actively raised awareness about the issue
- Media coverage reached "peak" with daily stories, scientists dismissed as ignoring or shouting down
- ABC News aired a program titled "The Killing Ground", empty coffins paraded in front of legislature
- Residents relocated at government expense, toxic waste cleanup became major environmental issue of 1980s
- Legislation (CERCLA) established Superfund and mandated toxic site cleanups
- Opinions divided on whether actual health damage was substantiated

**Alar Incident**:
- Alar, a chemical sprayed on apples to regulate growth/appearance, linked to cancerous tumors in rats/mice
- Media coverage triggered "availability cascade" and public fear, dominated news
- Apple industry suffered losses as apple products became objects of fear
- Manufacturer withdrew product, FDA banned it
- Subsequent research confirmed Alar might pose small risk as carcinogen
- Overreaction likely detrimental to public health due to fewer good apples consumed

### 14. Tom Ws Specialty

**Risks: Irrational Fears and Availability Cascades**

**Recognition of Risks**:
- We either ignore risks altogether or give them too much weight
- Difficulty reasoning oneself into a state of calm when faced with potential disasters

**Probability Neglect and Availability Cascades**:
- Probability neglect: failure to consider the probability of harm in relation to its impact
- Availability cascades: exaggeration of minor threats due to constant exposure and social mechanisms
- Terrorism as a significant practitioner of inducing availability cascades

**Consequences of Availability Cascades**:
- Distortion of priorities in allocating public resources
- Gross exaggeration of risks with important consequences

**Policy Implications**:
- Cass Sunstein: insulate decision makers from public pressures to allow impartial experts to determine resource allocation
- Paul Slovic: distrust expert decisions when disconnected from public emotions and accountability in a democracy

**Fear and Public Policy**:
- Fear is painful and debilitating, policy makers must protect the public from fear as well as real dangers
- Resistance to the idea of decisions being made by unelected and unaccountable experts

**Long-Term Benefits of Availability Cascades**:
- Increased attention on classes of risks and overall risk reduction budget
- Examples: Love Canal incident's effect on environmental concerns.

#### The Use of Base Rates in Problem Solving & Personality Profiling

**Democracy and Psychology**
- **Democracy**: Inevitably messy due to citizens' biased availability heuristics
- **Psychology**: Should inform design of risk policies combining experts' knowledge with public's emotions/intuitions
- **Availability Cascades**: Media inflates "nonevent," becomes all people talk about (quote from person A)
- **Tom W's Specialty**
  - Graduate student at main university in your state
  - Rank fields of graduate specialization by likelihood of enrollment for Tom W
    - Use base rates: proportion of students in each field among all graduates
      * Humanities and education > computer science or library science (more students overall)
  - No specific information about Tom W, so use base rates as default
- **Personality Sketch**: High intelligence but lacking creativity, needs order and clarity (quote from person B)
  - Lacks feel and sympathy for others, self-centered but has deep moral sense
- Rank fields of specialization based on how similar the description is to typical graduate student in each field.

#### Stereotypes and Predictive Judgments in Graduate Specialties

**Tom W Description and Stereotypes**
- Participants ranked graduate specialties based on their fit to Tom W description
- Ranking order:
    1. Computer Science
    2. Engineering
    3. Business Administration
    4. Physical and Life Sciences
    5. Library Science
    6. Law
    7. Medicine
    8. Humanities and Education
    9. Social Science and Social Work
- Rankings influenced by stereotypes
- Original ordering based on 1970s perceptions

**Task Complexity**
- Ranking task requires System 2 for discipline, sequential organization
- Activation of associations with stereotypes (System 1)
- Instructions focus on comparison between Tom W and field stereotypes.

**Predicting by Representativeness**
- Graduate students in psychology ranking task critical
- Participants knew:
    - Relevant statistical facts
    - Description source not highly trustworthy
- Ignoring base rates, focused on similarity to stereotypes (representativeness)
- Small fields ranked as high probability due to high representativeness score.

#### The Mistake of Judging by Representativeness

**Amos and the Study on Base Rates vs. Representativeness**

**Background:**
- Amos and I spent a year in Eugene working late nights
- Amos' task: create description pitting representativeness against base rates
- Description completed during early morning hours, named "Tom W"

**Robyn Dawes' Response:**
- Robyn, a statistics expert, struggled with the base rate concept
- Smiled slyly when guessed "computer scientist" as Tom W's profession
- Recognized mistake after being told about base rates

**Graduate Students' Behavior:**
- 114 psychology students from major universities involved
- Rankings of nine fields by probability did not differ from ratings by similarity to stereotype
- Substitution of representativeness for probability assessment was prevalent
- Students answered easier question about similarity instead

**Misconceptions:**
- Judgments of similarity and probability not interchangeable
- Ignoring base rates and quality of evidence in probability assessments leads to mistakes
- Probability (likelihood) has various definitions, often misunderstood by laypeople.

**The Concept of Probability:**
- Logicians and statisticians debate meaning
- Can be seen as a measure of subjective degree of belief
- Uncertainty, propensity, plausibility, and surprise also related to probability.

#### Overreliance on Representativeness in Prediction

**The Vagueness of Probability Assessment:**

**Understanding Representation and Predictive Heuristics**

**Background:**
- People understand the concept of probability to some extent, leading to automatic assessments based on representativeness heuristic.
- This mental shortcut can be inefficient but often more accurate than chance guesses.

**Representativeness Heuristic:**
- Activated when judging potential or predicting outcomes (e.g., election, career success).
- Involved in making intuitive impressions and judgments about similarity.
- Can lead to errors if base-rate information is neglected.

**Examples:**
1. Elvis Presley's parents wanted him to be a dentist: an automatically generated impression of dissimilarity between images.
2. Judging leadership potential based on facial features or speaking abilities: reliance on representativeness heuristic.
3. Billy Beane and Moneyball: using statistics instead of representativeness for player selection leads to better results.

**Accuracy vs. Efficiency:**
- Representation heuristic produces intuitive impressions, often accurate but not statistically optimal.
- Exclusive reliance on this heuristic can result in grave sins against statistical logic and incorrect predictions.
4. **Sins of Representativeness:**
   a) Overestimation of unlikely events due to base-rate neglect.
   b) Ignoring available information that contradicts stereotypes or expected patterns (false positives).
5. **Implications:**
   - Understanding the limitations of representativeness heuristic is essential for making accurate predictions and judgments.
   - Considering multiple factors beyond representativeness can improve decision-making processes.

#### The Influence of Emotions on Predictive Judgment in the Tom W Problem

**Base Rates vs. Representativeness:**
- Example: person reading The New York Times on subway
- Representativeness would assume PhD more likely, but this may not be the case
- Importance of considering base rates (number of individuals in specific population)
  - Many more nongraduates than PhDs ride New York subways
  - Business students likely outnumber poetry lovers

**Use of Base Rates:**
- People without statistics training can use base rates for predictions under certain conditions
- Base rate information should be considered alongside specific instance information
- Experiments show participants are influenced by base rates when explicitly provided
- Instruction to "think like a statistician" enhances use of base rate information
  - Opposite effect with instruction to "think like a clinician"

**Tom W Problem:**
- Original belief: base-rate information neglected when specific instance available
- Experiment on Harvard undergraduates: enhanced activation of System 2 improved predictive accuracy
  - Students puffed cheeks relied exclusively on representativeness, ignored base rates
  - Frowning students showed sensitivity to base rates

**Conclusion:**
- System 1 suggests incorrect intuition
- System 2 responsible for endorsing it and expressing judgment
- Failure of System 2 could be due to ignorance or laziness.

#### Overcoming Base Rate Neglect and the Representation Heuristic in Decision Making

**Base Rates and Representativeness**

**Base Rate Neglect**:
- Ignoring base rates due to individual information
- Laziness is a likely explanation for this error, particularly among Harvard undergrads
- System 2 "knows" base rates are relevant, but only applies them when investing effort

**Insensitivity to Evidence Quality**:
- WYSIATI (What You See Is All That There Is) rule in System 1 causes misinterpretation of evidence quality
- When presented with potentially incorrect information, keep judgments close to base rates
- Requires self-monitoring and control to maintain this discipline

**Disciplining Intuition**:
- Beliefs should be constrained by probability logic
- Properly adjust probabilities based on available evidence and base rates using Bayesian statistics
- Base rates are crucial in correctly estimating probabilities, even if the information provided is flawed.

### 15. Linda Less is More

**The Role of Representativeness in Reasoning:**
* **Anchoring judgments on plausible base rates**: Consider the probability of an outcome based on available data and common occurrences (e.g., thriving start-ups have a low success rate).
* **Questioning diagnosticity of evidence**: Don't assume strong evidence automatically equals high probability; allow for uncertainty in your thinking.
* The Linda Problem: A case study demonstrating heuristics and their incompatibility with logic
	+ Description of Linda: 31-year-old single woman interested in philosophy, social justice, and feminism
	+ Participants ranked scenarios based on representativeness or probability
	+ Results showed a consensus that Linda fits better as a "feminist bank teller" than a stereotypical bank teller
* Critical items to note: The difference between fitting the description of "Linda as a feminist bank teller" vs. "bank teller" emphasizes how representativeness can lead us astray from logical reasoning based on probabilities.

#### The Linda Paradox: Logic vs Representativeness Failure

**Logical Relation between Scenarios**
- **Venn Diagrams**: Set of feminist bank tellers is wholly included in set of bank tellers
- Probability of Linda being a feminist bank teller lower than probability of her being a bank teller
- Conflict between intuition and logic

**Initial Experiment Results**
- Between-subjects design: identical average rankings for resemblance and likelihood

**Within-Subject Design Findings**
- Ranking of "feminist bank teller" higher than "bank teller"
- Surprising results despite logical relation
- Over 80% of undergraduates and doctoral students made the same error

**Linda Questionnaire Extensions**
- Controversy surrounding the problem's simplicity
- Introduced larger groups to Linda and her scenarios
- Continued findings: 89% of participants ranked "feminist bank teller" as more probable.

#### Undergraduates' Susceptibility to Logical Fallacies and the Linda Problem

**Conjunction Fallacy**
- About 85% to 90% of undergraduates at major universities chose the "wrong" option in a logical problem (contrary to probability)
- This phenomenon is called a **conjunction fallacy**
- People commit this fallacy when they judge a conjunction of two events to be more probable than one event in a direct comparison
- The fallacy remains attractive even when recognized as flawed

**Explanation of the Linda Problem**
- Naturalist Stephen Jay Gould described his struggle with the Linda problem:
  - Knew the correct answer but was still tempted by the "fallacy"
  - Described a "little homunculus in my head" that kept insisting she couldn't just be a bank teller
- The longer version of the problem (with an intervening item) allowed more statistically sophisticated students to avoid the fallacy, as it required independent judgments

**Representativeness and Probability**
- The judgments of probability in the Tom W and Linda problems corresponded precisely to judgments of **representativeness** (similarity to stereotypes)
- Representativeness is a cluster of related assessments that are easily confused with probability
  - The most representative outcomes combine with the personality description to produce the most coherent stories
  - The most coherent stories are not necessarily the most probable, but they are **plausible**
- The uncritical substitution of plausibility for probability has pernicious effects on judgments when scenarios are used as forecasting tools

#### "Less Is More: The Paradox of Valuing Incomplete Sets"

**Scenario Detail and Probability**
- Probability judgments higher for richer, more detailed scenarios (contrary to logic)
- Adding detail makes scenarios more persuasive but less likely to come true
- Plausibility role:
  - Evaluation of plausibility and coherence does not suggest answer to probability question
  - Logic prevails in absence of competing intuition

**Joint vs. Single Evaluation**
- Christopher Hsee's experiment on dinnerware sets:
  - **Joint evaluation**: Comparison of two sets, no clear answer (average dominates evaluation)
    - Set A: 40 pieces (24 intact), valued slightly less than Set B in joint evaluation but more in single evaluation
  - **Single evaluation**: Only one set shown, clear answer based on individual set
    - Set A: worth less than expected due to broken dishes
- Economic theory perspective: Economic value is a sum-like variable, adding positively valued items should increase its value.

#### The Conjunction Fallacy and Representation Bias in Probability Judgments

**The Linda Problem and Dinnerware Problem**
- Both problems have the same structure
- Probability is a **sum-like variable**, similar to economic value (e.g., probability(Linda is a teller) = probability(Linda is feminist teller) + probability(Linda is non-feminist teller))
- Single evaluations of the Linda problem produce a "less-is-more" pattern due to System 1 averaging instead of adding (Hsee's dinnerware study)
- The sum-like nature of probability is less obvious than economic value

**Joint Evaluation Eliminates Errors Only in Hsee's Experiment, Not Linda Experiment**
- Linda was not the only conjunction error to survive joint evaluation
- Participants in one study were asked to rank outcomes of Wimbledon tournament:
  A. Borg will win the match
  B. Borg will lose the first set
  C. Borg will lose the first set but win the match
  D. Borg will win the first set but lose the match
- **B** is more inclusive and should have a higher probability than **C**, but 72% assigned **B** a lower probability (another instance of "less is more")
- Scenario judged as more probable was also more plausible, a better fit with known information about Borg

**Probability Judgments Without Using the Term "Probability"**
- Participants told about a six-sided die with 4 green and 2 red faces, and rolled 20 times
- Given sequences: RGRRR, GRGRRR, GRRRRR
- Sequence 1 (RGRRR) is unrepresentative, while sequence 2 (GRGRRR) is a better fit but less likely due to being constructed by adding a G to the first sequence
- **Representativeness dominated**, and almost two-thirds preferred to bet on sequence 2 rather than 1
- After being presented with arguments, a large majority found the correct argument (favoring sequence 1) more convincing

#### The Lazy Logic of System 2: Understanding the Conjunction Fallacy

**Reduction of Conjunction Fallacy Incidence**
* Problem variant on right led to lower error rate (25% vs 65%)
* Explanation: reference to "100 participants" brings spatial representation, making inclusion relation apparent

**Spatial Representation and its Impact on Reasoning**
* Frequency representation not obvious in "what percentage?" question
* Experiments show frequency representation makes it easy to grasp subset inclusions
* Imagery of people sorting themselves into groups demonstrates this concept

**Insights from Studies on Conjunction Fallacy**
* System 2, though aware of logic, can be lazy and inconsistent in application
* Not everyone shares vivid imagery for frequency representation
* Thousands have fallen to conjunction fallacy due to plausibility

**The Role of Representation in Reasoning**
* Conjunction fallacy: less-is-more pattern not apparent in all cases
* Factors influencing the use of System 2 (laziness, time pressure)
* Importance of understanding representation's role in reasoning.

#### Linda Problem: Intuition vs Logic in Cognitive Illusions

**The Two Problems: Intuition vs. Logic**

**Structure of the Problems**:
- Dinnerware Set:
    - Subjects see set with broken dishes
    - Intuitive judgment leads to low price estimation
    - Logical application of rule adds value
- Linda Problem:
    - Intuition often overcomes logic in joint evaluation
    - Some conditions allow logic to prevail

**Reactions and Criticism**:
- Researchers found ways to reduce the incidence of the fallacy
- Arguments that "probability" means "plausibility" in this context
- Suggestions that the entire enterprise was misguided
- Focus on weaknesses instead of addressing the unique feature of the conjunction fallacy

**Impact on Researchers**:
- Increased visibility to the general public
- Dent in credibility among scholars in the field

**Comparing Criticism Styles**:
- Lawyers: Demolish strong arguments and discredit witnesses
- Scientific controversies: Should focus on addressing unique features, not just weaknesses

### 16. Causes Trump Statistics

**Factors Affecting Debate Norms in Social Sciences:**
- **Prevalence of bias in human judgment**: large issue not prohibited in debate
- **Acceptance of political argument style**: acceptable when dealing with significant issues
- **Example: The Linda Problem** and its criticism by Ralph Hertwig
  - Exclusive focus on conjunction fallacy
  - Attraction due to widespread attention

**Lessons from Less is More:**
- Complex scenarios can make logical thinking difficult
- Intuition sometimes outweighs logic (even when answer seems obvious)

**Impact of Base Rates in Probability Calculations:**
- **Scenario 1**: standard problem of Bayesian inference with a base rate and imperfect witness testimony
  - Original version: people often ignore base rate information
- **Scenario 2**: same story but altered presentation of base rate
  - People give significant weight to the base rate in their judgment
  - Resulting average judgment closer to Bayesian solution.

#### Understanding Base Rates: Statistical vs Causal Implications in Stereotypes

**Causal Base Rates vs. Statistical Base Rates**

**Causal Base Rates**:
- Relevant to individual cases
- Change your view on how the case came to be
- Treated as information about the individual case
- Easily combined with other specific information
- Example: "Green drivers are dangerous"

**Statistical Base Rates**:
- Facts about a population
- Not relevant to the individual case
- Often underweighted or neglected when specific information is available
- Example: "Most graduates of this inner-city school go to college"

**Stereotyping**:
- Statements about groups that are accepted as facts about every member
- Can set up a propensity in individual members
- Neutral term, but often carries a negative connotation in popular usage

**Cab Example**:
- Base rate of Blue cabs vs. Green cabs is a statistical fact
- However, the causal base rate introduces the idea that Green drivers cause more accidents
- This leads to a causal story about reckless Green drivers
- The two causal stories (hit and run vs. witness testimony) are contradictory and need to be reconciled

#### The Power of Causal Base Rates in Judgment and Decision Making

**Stereotypes and Causal Base Rates**

**What are Stereotypes?**
- Representations of "normal" members within categories (e.g., horses, refrigerators, police officers)
- Social stereotypes: perniciously wrong and have consequences
- Psychological fact: how we think of categories

**Neglecting Base Rates vs. Stereotyping**
- In some contexts, stereotyping improves accuracy (e.g., cab problem)
- Socially desirable to reject individual judgments based on group statistics (anti-stereotyping social norm)
- Costs of anti-stereotyping: suboptimal judgments

**Causal Base Rates**
- Notion borrowed from psychologist Icek Ajzen
- Causal factor in determining outcomes (e.g., passing a test)
- Manipulation of causal base rates: Ajzen's experiment on students and exam results
  - High success rate condition: students judged more likely to pass
  - High failure rate condition: students judged less likely to pass
- Noncausal base rate suggestion: Ajzen used an ingenious method.

#### Impact of Base Rates on Stereotyping: The Helping Experiment

**Causal Base Rates vs. Statistical Facts**

**Causal Base Rates**:
- Used to infer stereotypical traits about individuals
- Affected judgments more than statistical facts

**Statistical Facts**:
- Purely statistical information about a sample
- Had less impact on judgment than causal base rates

**Experiment: Can Psychology be Taught?**
- Participants told about the "helping experiment" at New York University
- Stooge described personal problems, then became agitated and choked during next turn
- Participants failed to draw inference from statistical base rate (that the choking could have been a random occurrence)
- Conclusion: Teaching psychology is wasteful when people's existing beliefs conflict with statistical information

#### The Diffusion of Responsibility in Helping Behavior Experiment

**Experiment Results: Helping Behavior**

**Participant Responses**:
- Only 4 out of 15 participants responded immediately to the appeal for help
- 6 never left their booth, and 5 others came out later
- Individuals felt relieved of responsibility when they knew others could respond

**Expectations vs. Reality**:
- Most people assume they would rush to help in such a situation
- But even "normal, decent people" may not step forward when others are present

**Changing Beliefs about Human Nature**:
- Students were asked to infer the causal factor behind the low rate of helpfulness: diffusion of responsibility
- Changing one's mind about human nature is difficult, especially if it requires admitting weakness in oneself

**Experiment Design and Limitations**:
- Students were shown videos of participants from the New York study
- Interviewees appeared normal and decent, but their actual helping behavior was not discussed
- Students may have just recited the "official" interpretation without truly changing their beliefs.

#### Bayesian Reasoning and Helping Behavior: Learning from Experiment Results

**Bayesian Reasoning Application**

**Background:**
- Prior belief about unspecified participant: not helpful (27% chance)
- Base rate information: only 4 out of 15 participants helped immediately

**Question:** What would you guess about two individuals without seeing their interviews?

**Bayesian Logic:**
1. Consult base rate
2. Adjust judgment with relevant new information
3. Stay with base rates in absence of useful new data

**Study Findings:**
- Group 1: Predictions based on human nature and understanding of situation
  * Predicted both individuals would rush to aid
- Group 2: Knowledge of procedure and results
  * Predictions identical to Group 1

**Implications for Psychology Teachers:**
- Students learned nothing from helping experiment results
- Remained convinced that individuals on video were quick to help.

### 17. Regression to the Mean

**Surprising Experiments in Psychology**

**The Helping Experiment**:
- Students are shown videos of individuals not helping a stranger
- Teachers expect this to change students' understanding of human behavior
- However, Nisbett and Borgida found that students' guesses were not accurate

**Teaching Psychology Effectively**:
- To teach new psychology, the student must be surprised
- Presenting surprising statistical facts or cases is effective
- Surprising individual cases are more powerful than statistics
- Incongruity between expectations and reality must be resolved
- Causal stories help embed the learning

**Limitations of Statistical Information**:
- Students may learn new facts but not change their understanding
- Compelling causal statistics may not change long-held beliefs
- Personal experience is a significant factor in belief formation

**Surprising Individual Cases**:
- Surprising individual cases have a powerful impact
- They are more effective than statistical results alone
- Students can infer the general from the particular

#### Regression to the Mean: The Psychology of Training and Statistical Fluctuations

**Regression to the Mean**
- **Praising Performance vs Punishing Mistakes**: Rewards for improved performance work better than punishment of mistakes
- Evidence from research on various animals supports this principle
- Speaker shares personal experience with flight instructors in Israeli Air Force
- One instructor disagrees, stating that praising a cadet's performance results in worse execution on next try
- Opposite is also true: Punishing a cadet's poor performance leads to better execution on next try
- Instructor observed **regression to the mean**, where performance fluctuates around an average
- Incorrectly attributed causal interpretation to random fluctuations in performance
- Chalk marking target on floor used to illustrate concept instead of algebraic prediction.

#### Talent vs Luck: The Influence on Success in Sports Performance

**Experiment with Flight Instructors**
- Measured accuracy of officers throwing coins at a target:
  * Some improved after first try (deteriorated on second)
  * Others deteriorated after first try (improved on second)

**Feedback and Human Condition**
- Punishment leads to improvement due to feedback loop
- Talent and luck contribute to success

**Golf Tournament Example**
- Focusing on a golfer's score:
  * Above-average score = above-average talent + lucky day
  * Below-average score = below-average talent + unlucky day

**Predicting Performance on Day 2**
- Talent assumed to remain constant
- Predictions based on day 1 scores:
  * Above average -> above average talent, lucky day
  * Below average -> below average talent, unlucky day

#### Regression to the Mean: An Unpredictable Phenomenon

**Understanding Regression to the Mean**

**Regression to the Mean**:
- Observed phenomenon where extreme results regress towards the average over time
- Not caused by any specific mechanism or causal explanation, but rather due to the tendency for luck to even out

**Golfers' Performance Example**:
- Golfer who did well on Day 1 is likely to perform less well on Day 2 due to regression to the mean
- Golfer who did poorly on Day 1 is likely to improve on Day 2 due to regression to the mean
- Difference between their performance should shrink, although the first golfer is still expected to outperform the second

**Regression to the Mean in General**:
- The more extreme an original score, the greater the regression is expected to be
- Regression effects are ubiquitous and often lead to misguided causal stories (e.g., "Sports Illustrated Jinx")
- The real explanation for regression to the mean is that exceptional performance in one time period is often due to luck, which tends to even out over time

#### "Regression Towards Mediocrity: The Discovery of Statistical Regression"

**Regression Towards Mediocrity: Understanding the Phenomenon**

**Introduction**:
- Regression towards mediocrity is a statistical regularity observed when the correlation between two measures is less than perfect
- Discovered and named late in the 19th century by Sir Francis Galton
- Initially surprised by the observation, as it is common and found everywhere

**Galton's Experiments**:
- Measured size in successive generations of seeds
- Noted offspring tended to be more mediocre than their parent seeds in size
- Observed the mean filial regression towards mediocrity was directly proportional to the parental deviation from it

**Significance of the Discovery**:
- Galton presented his findings in a lecture before the Royal Institution, surprising his learned audience
- Took several years for Galton to understand that regression occurs when the correlation between variables is less than perfect
- Regression effects can be found in various measures, but often go unnoticed

**Measuring Regression Between Variables**:
- Measured using the population as a standard of reference
- If one variable (e.g., Jane's piano playing) ranks differently than another (e.g., her weight), it indicates regression towards mediocrity in the second variable.

#### Understanding Regression Towards the Mean: Correlation Insights

**Assumptions Simplifying Analysis:**
- Piano-playing success depends only on weekly hours of practice (simplified as "practice")
- Weight depends only on consumption of ice cream (simplified as "ice cream")
- No relation between practice and ice cream consumption

**Statistical Concepts:**
- Regression to the mean: When predicting one variable from another, the relationship is not perfect and there will be a regression towards the average.
- Correlation coefficient: Measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables.

**Examples of Correlations:**
1. Size of objects measured in different units: correlation = 1 (100% shared factors)
2. Self-reported height and weight among adult American males: correlation = .41
3. SAT scores and college GPA: correlation = approximately .60
4. Income and education level in the US: correlation = approximately .40
5. Family income and last four digits of phone number: correlation = 0

**Galton's Insight:**
- Correlation and regression are related concepts, not separate ideas.
- When the correlation between two variables is imperfect, there will be regression towards the mean.

**Interesting Fact:**
- Highly intelligent women tend to marry men who are less intelligent than they are (regression to the mean effect).

#### Regression to the Mean: A Source of Confusion in Statistics and Everyday Life

**Interpreting Correlation vs. Regression**

**Spontaneous Interpretation of Correlation:**
- People may interpret correlation as causal:
  - Highly intelligent women avoiding competition or compromising in marriage with intelligent men
  - Imperfect correlation between spouses' intelligence scores not interesting, no explanation required

**Regression to the Mean**:
- Algebraically equivalent to imperfect correlation between spouses' intelligence scores
- Regression to the mean is a mathematical inevitability if the correlation is less than perfect
- Difficulty understanding regression due to:
  - Strong bias toward causal explanations (System 1)
  - Lack of causal force in explanation (System 2)

**Examples**:
- Golfers' performance deterioration after success on day 1
  * Best explanation: Unusual luck that day, not cause for improvement
- Depressed children showing improvement over time
  * Regression to the mean, not a result of treatment (e.g., energy drink or cat hugging)

**Conclusion**:
- Difficulty understanding regression originates from both System 1 and System 2's insistent demand for causal interpretations.

### 18. Taming Intuitive Predictions

**Regression Effects in Research:**
* Control group expected to improve by regression alone
* Determine if treated patients improve more than regression can explain
* Misconceptions about causation not restricted to popular press
* Eminent researchers make same mistake: confusing correlation with causation
* Regression effects a common source of trouble in research
* Healthy fear of unwarranted causal inference among experienced scientists

**Intuitive Predictions:**
* Sales forecasting example for department store chain
	+ Accept overall forecast of economists (10% increase)
	+ Forecast sales for each store in 2012
* Regression required: add more to low-performing branches, less to others
* Intuitive solution: add same percentage to all stores is wrong
* Confusion between correlation and causation

**Regression to Mediocrity:**
* Criticism more effective than praise due to regression effect (Galton's discovery)
* Unexpectedly good first interview can be less impressive in the second one
* Anticipate regression in screening procedures and assessments

**Taming Intuitive Predictions:**
* Occasions for forecasting: economy, finance, military, business, personal life
* Regression effects present in various aspects of life.

#### Intuitive Predictions: A Cognitive Process Examined

**Intuitive Judgments and Predictive Thinking:**
* **Some predictions rely on System 1**: intuition, skill, expertise, and heuristics
* **Skilled intuitions**: rapid judgments based on recognition of familiar cues (chess masters, firefighters, physicians)
* **Heuristic intuitions**: substitution of easy question for harder one (Julie's GPA prediction)
* **Nonregressive intuitions**: made with high confidence despite weak evidence

**Process of Making Intuitive Judgments:**
1. Seek causal link between evidence and target of prediction:
   - Early reading = academic talent
   - Fly fishing, weight lifting = irrelevant to GPA prediction
2. Evaluate evidence in relation to relevant norm or reference group:
   - Four-year-old fluent reader = above average for academic ability
3. Substitution and intensity matching:
   - Assign percentage score for Julie's academic achievements (GPA) based on early reading ability
4. Translation: convert general impression of relative academic standing into corresponding GPA.

**System 1 Operations:**
- Dichotomous process: reject irrelevant or false information, but cannot adjust for smaller weaknesses in evidence
- Insensitive to predictive quality of evidence when making intuitive predictions
- WYSIATI (What You See Is What You Get) application: construct the best possible story from available information.

#### Perceived Academic Ability vs Predicted GPA: A Study on Intensity Matching Bias

**Intensity Matching**
- Yields extreme predictions based on evidence
- Leads to same answer for different questions:
    - What is Julie's percentile score on reading precocity?
    - What is Julie's percentile score on GPA?
- **Process of spreading activation**:
    - Initially prompted by evidence and question
    - Feeds back upon itself
    - Settles on most coherent solution

**Experiment Design**
- Participants evaluated descriptions of college freshmen
- Each description contained 5 adjectives (e.g., "intelligent, self-confident, well-read, hardworking, inquisitive")
- Participants answered two types of questions:
    - **Evaluating the evidence**:
        - How much does this description impress you with respect to academic ability?
        - What percentage of descriptions would impress you more?
    - **Predicting the ultimate outcome**:
        - What is your estimate of the GPA the student will obtain?
        - What is the percentage of freshmen who would have a higher GPA?
- Researchers compared participants' percentile judgments between evaluating evidence and predicting outcomes

**Findings**
- Participants treated both sets of questions as if they were the same
    - Despite differences in required judgments (evaluate evidence vs. predict outcome)

#### Intuitive Predictions: Evidence of Substitution and Intensity Matching

**Predictions and Evaluation:**
- Prediction of future matches evaluation (ignoring uncertainty)
- Substitution: people answer questions intended for predictions with evaluations of current evidence
- Military example: officers' forecasts of cadet grades identical to actual grades
  * Failure to distinguish tasks
  * Intensity matching

**Intuitive Predictions:**
- Schematic formula for factors determining reading age and college GPA
- Shared factors: genetically determined aptitude, family support, academic interests
- Unique factors: specific to reading age or GPA.

#### Regressing Intuitive Predictions: A Case Study on Reading Age and GPA

**Factors Affecting Reading Ability and Academic Performance**

**Factors Affecting Outcomes:**
- Julie's reading age
- Her GPA

**Estimate of Shared Factors:**
- Difficult to determine
- Optimistic guess: approximately 30% correlation between the two measures

**Unbiased Prediction Method:**
1. Start with an estimate of average GPA (baseline)
2. Determine intuitive prediction based on evidence
3. Estimate correlation between evidence and GPA
4. Move 30% of the distance from baseline to intuitive prediction

**Application:**
- Predicting quantitative variables, such as profit or company growth
- Approach builds on intuition but moderates it towards the mean
- More accurate when correlation is trusted

**Intuitive Predictions vs. Regression:**
- Intuitive predictions are biased due to lack of regression towards the mean
- Overly optimistic for those who did well initially and overly pessimistic for those with poor starts.

#### Correcting Intuitive Predictions for Unbiased Outcomes

**Correcting Intuitive Predictions:**
* Eliminates biases in discrete and numerical predictions
* Balances overestimation and underestimation of true value
* Two main components: baseline prediction, intuitive prediction

**Baseline Prediction:**
- In categorical predictions: base rate (probability of a specified event)
- In numerical predictions: average outcome in relevant category

**Intuitive Prediction:**
- Expresses the number that comes to your mind
- Can be a probability or GPA
- Aim for an intermediate prediction between baseline and intuition

**Procedure:**
1. Default case with no useful evidence: stay with baseline
2. Full confidence in initial prediction after critical review of evidence: stay with intuitive prediction
3. Find reason to doubt the correlation between judgment and truth: move towards unbiased predictions
4. High stakes and desire for accurate results justifies effort required for correction
5. Unbiased predictions do not allow rare or extreme events unless information is very good.

**Biases Addressed:**
- Overconfidence in intuitive predictions
- Extreme predictions.

#### Biased Predictions: When Extreme Language Offers Comfort

**Limitations of Intuitive Predictions:**
- **Absence of bias not always important**: some errors more significant than others
- **Preference for unbiased predictions**: justified only if all errors treated equally
- Situations where one type of error is worse than another:
  - Venture capitalists: focusing on identifying next big thing, risk of missing out greater than risk of investing in failures
  - Conservative banker: risk of single borrower default outweighs risk of turning down several clients

**Rational Approach to Predictions:**
- **Unbiased and moderate predictions**: not a problem for rational individuals
- Rational person: considers range of uncertainty around most likely outcome, invests in enterprises with highest potential rewards despite known risks

**Delusion and Self-Awareness:**
- Not all individuals are rational
- Deluding oneself with extreme predictions may provide comfort, but not accurate
- Awareness of self-indulgence important: think about how much you know.

#### Balancing Intuition and Data in Decision Making

**Choosing Between Candidates: Kim vs Jane**

**Background:**
- Two candidates for a position: Kim and Jane
- Kim: recently completed graduate work, spectacular recommendations, brilliant talk, no substantial scientific productivity
- Jane: held postdoctoral position for 3 years, productive research record, excellent research, less sparkling interviews

**Intuitive Choice vs. Rational Choice:**
- Intuitive choice favors Kim due to stronger impression (WYSIATI)
- However, there is less information about Kim compared to Jane
- Smaller sample size leads to more uncertainty and potential for extreme outcomes

**Regression Toward the Mean:**
- Regress prediction more deeply toward the mean for Kim's future performance
- Kim is likely to regress more than Jane due to less information available

**Implications:**
- Follow intuitions but be aware of their limitations
- Consider all factors carefully, including uncertainty and potential for regression towards the mean.

**Contextual Application:**
- Venture capitalist choosing between investments: assess market certainty and prospects carefully.

### 19. The Illusion of Understanding

**Manifesations of System 1:**
- Extreme predictions from weak evidence (overconfidence)
- Natural for associative machinery to match extremeness of predictions to perceived evidence
- Intuitions deliver overly extreme and often incorrect predictions
- Regression to the mean is a problem for both system and user understanding

**Understanding Regression:**
- Difficult concept to comprehend, even with experience
- Misinterpreted as causal interpretations that are usually wrong
- Importance of considering large sample sizes and not just individual events

**System 2 Requirements:**
- Special training needed for understanding regression
- Complexity of narrative fallacy can lead to flawed stories being accepted as true
- Narrative fallacies arise from attempting to make sense of the world

**Narrative Fallacy:**
- Simplistic explanatory stories that are compelling
- Focus on recent salient events rather than countless non-occurrences
- Assign larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than luck
- Illusion of inevitability fostered by a compelling narrative.

#### Limitations of Attributing Success to Skill: The Google Case Study

**Google's Success Story:**
* Two Stanford graduates develop superior search method for Internet
* Secure funding to start company
* Make successful decisions leading to company growth
* Become wealthy and influential in technology industry

**Luck vs. Skill:**
* Google's story compelling due to element of luck
* Many critical decisions had good outcomes
* No single narrative can account for all events affecting outcome
* Human mind struggles with nonevents
* Importance of understanding role of luck versus skill

**The Halo Effect:**
* Google founders appear invincible in story
* Success attributed to prescience and skill
* Overlooked potential disruptions or misfortunes
* Misleading sense of understanding and learning value.

**Lessons Learned:**
* No single explanation fully captures success stories
* Importance of recognizing role of luck vs. skill
* Human mind often overlooks nonevents in favor of compelling narratives.

#### The Illusion of Knowing the Past

**The Limits of Knowledge and Hindsight Bias:**
- Google story: skill vs. luck (Google story exaggerates role of skill, while luck played a significant part)
- Human tendency to construct coherent stories from limited information
- WYSIATI rule (you deal with the limited info as if it's all there is to know)

**Misuse of the Word "Knew":**
- Common misconception that people could have predicted 2008 financial crisis
- Misuse of words like "knew," "intuition," and "premonition"
- These words imply a false sense of knowability in the future

**Understanding the Past:**
- We believe we understand the past more than we actually do (illusion of knowledge)
- Language perpetuates this illusion: "know," "intuition," and "premonition" should be used with caution.

**Social Costs of Hindsight Bias:**
- Narratives about the past are a form of sense-making (we adjust our view of the world to accommodate surprises)
- Revised models of the world alter perceptions of the past and future.

#### Hindsight Bias: Overestimating Past Beliefs After Events Occur

**Effects of Changing Minds and Hindsight Bias**

**Learning from Surprises**:
- Can have dangerous consequences
- Imperfect ability to reconstruct past states of knowledge or beliefs

**Hindsight Bias**:
- Experiment where people change their minds:
  - Carefully measure attitudes before exposure to persuasive message
  - Measure attitudes again after being exposed to message
  - Participants often retrieve current, not original, beliefs
  - Difficulty recalling past beliefs

**Effects of Hindsight Bias**:
- Inevitably causes underestimation of surprise from past events
- Leads to overstating the accuracy of:
  - One's own original predictions
  - Predictions made by others

**Hindsight Bias in Decision Making**:
- Pernicious effects on evaluations of decision makers
- Causes assessments to focus on outcome quality, not process soundness
  - Example: Assessing a low-risk surgical intervention with an unexpected adverse outcome
    - Tendency is to believe the operation was actually risky and doctor should have known better

#### Hindsight Bias and its Impact on Decision-Making Accountability

**Outcome Bias and Decision Making**

**Impact on Evaluating Decisions**:
- Hindsight makes it difficult to evaluate decisions properly based on initial beliefs
- Decision makers blamed for good decisions that went bad, and given too little credit for successful moves
- Outcome bias: 
    - When outcomes are bad, clients blame agents for not seeing the "handwriting on the wall"
    - Actions appearing prudent in foresight can look irresponsibly negligent in hindsight

**Case Studies**:
- Students were asked whether Duluth, MN should have hired a full-time bridge monitor to prevent debris from blocking the river:
    - 24% said yes when only shown evidence at time of decision
    - 56% said yes after being informed of major flood damage
- In case of 9/11, officials were criticized for not anticipating the attacks
- CIA obtained information on July 10, 2001 about possible al-Qaeda attack, but did not bring it to President Bush until later
    - Critics said this was negligent, but it was not clear at the time how significant the information was

**Decision Making and Accountability**:
- Decision makers expect scrutiny, leading to:
    - Adherence to standard operating procedures
    - Extreme reluctance to take risks
- Physicians have changed practices in response to increased malpractice litigation:
    - Ordered more tests, referred more cases to specialists, applied conventional treatments even when unlikely to help
    - Protected physicians more than benefited patients, creating potential conflicts of interest

#### The Illusion of CEO Influence on Business Outcomes

**Impact of Hindsight on Risk Perception:**
- Hindsight can lead to risk aversion or false confidence in success
- Undeserved rewards for irresponsible risk takers who win
- Lucky leaders may be perceived as prescient and bold

**Illusions that Comfort Us:**
- World appears more tidy, simple, predictable, and coherent than it is
- Belief that actions have appropriate consequences
- Need for reassurance that success rewards wisdom and courage

**Business Books and CEO Influence:**
- Leaders and management practices influence firm outcomes
- Research shows smaller effect size than assumed
- Correlation between CEO quality and firm success: up to .30 (30%) overlap

**Significance of a Correlation Coefficient:**
- Indicates strength of relationship between two measures
- In a well-ordered world, correlation would be perfect (1)
- If success depends on uncontrollable factors, weaker CEO leads stronger firm 50% of the time
- A correlation of .30 implies stronger CEO leads stronger firm in about 60% of cases.

#### The Halo Effect: An Exaggerated Influence on Perceptions of Success in Business

**Halo Effect and Business Writing:**

**Understanding the Illusion of Understanding**

**The Halo Effect**:
- Significant advantage to improve odds from 1:1 to 3:2
- Difficult for business writers to acknowledge lack of control over performance
- Consumers seek clear message about determinants of success and failure

**Stories of Success and Failure**:
- Exaggerate impact of leadership style and management practices on firm outcomes
- Misrepresent causal relationship between CEOs, firms, and results
- Illusions born from halo effect and outcome bias

**The Appeal of "Success Stories"**:
- Books that draw operational morals from successful businesses
- Good managerial practices overstated due to presence of luck
- Consistent patterns in comparisons of successful and less successful firms can be mirages.

### 20. The Illusion of Validity

**The Illusion of Validity:**

**Understanding Success and Failure**
- **Limitations of Foreknowledge**: vision and competence do not guarantee corporate success
- **Regression to the Mean**: average gap between successful and less successful firms shrinks over time due to luck

**Stories of Business Rise and Fall:**
- Offer simplistic messages of triumph and failure
- Induce illusion of understanding with little enduring value
- Ignore the role of luck and inevitability of regression

**Hindsight Bias**:
- Mistakes appear obvious after the fact (hindsight)
- Can lead to incorrect assumptions about causality
- Misattribution of success or failure

**The Illusion of Validity:**
- Our beliefs have little correlation with actual evidence
- Confidence in beliefs is based on coherence of the story constructed by System 1 and System 2
- Poor quality evidence can produce a good story, leading to false conclusions.

#### "Leader Evaluation through Stress Testing"

**Psychological Assessment for Officer Training**

**The Leaderless Group Challenge**:
- Conducted as part of a psychological assessment for officer training in the Israeli Army
- Involved 8 candidates, strangers to each other, with no insignia of rank
- Tasked with lifting a log and transporting it to a wall without touching the ground or the wall
- Required teamwork and problem-solving under stress

**Observations of Candidate Behavior**:
- Who took charge and led the group
- Who tried to lead but was rebuffed
- Level of cooperation and contribution to the group effort
- Signs of stubbornness, submissiveness, arrogance, patience, hot temper, persistence, or quitting
- Competitive spite when ideas were rejected by the group
- Reactions to crisis, such as berating a comrade or stepping up to lead

**Evaluating Candidate Leadership Abilities**:
- Observers made notes on each candidate's leadership skills and assigned numerical scores
- Discussed their impressions and converged on a coherent story about each soldier's leadership potential
- Some candidates appeared strong leaders, while others seemed weak or unsuitable for officer rank

#### Illusion of Validity: Overconfidence in Predictions Despite Evidence to Contradict

**The Illusion of Validity**

**Soldier's Performance Evaluation**:
- Soldiers' performance during obstacle course revealed their true nature
- Predicting their future performance was unreliable, but evaluations were confident
- Previous failures at accurately predicting performance had no effect on evaluations

**Cognitive Illusion**:
- Known that predictions were largely useless, yet acted as if they were valid
- Reminded of the Müller-Lyer illusion - knowing something is false yet perceiving it as true
- Instances of substitution and representativeness in evaluations

**Evaluation Process**:
- Observer's impressions of soldiers' performance during obstacle course were clear
- Single score predicted future success or failure with confidence
- No questioning, doubting, or equivocating in forecasts
- Admitting that anything could happen was a mere formality

**Feedback and Confidence**:
- Regular feedback sessions on cadet performance at officer school
- Comparing assessments against commanders' opinions confirmed negligible predictive ability
- Continued confidence in individual predictions despite global evidence of failure

#### The Illusion of Stock-Market Skill

**The Illusion of Stock-Picking Skill**

**Background:**
- Amos Tversky and the author visited a Wall Street firm in 1984
- Discussed role of judgment biases in investing with senior investment manager
- Author knew little about finance, but remembered questioning origin of buyers and sellers' different opinions

**The Puzzle:**
- Billions of shares traded daily with differing opinions on price
- Buyers believe price is too low, likely to rise; sellers believe it's high, likely to drop
- Question: Why do they think the market is wrong? Illusion of skill at work?

**Standard Theory:**
- Major industry built on an illusion of skill
- Participants accept standard theory of how stock market works
- Belief in personal superiority over market is widespread.

#### Individual Investors' Trading Decisions Lead to Consistent Losses

**Malkiel's Random Walk Theory**
- **A Random Walk Down Wall Street**: Burton Malkiel's book arguing that stock prices incorporate all available knowledge and predictions.
- The theory states that no one can consistently beat the market by trading, as prices are "correctly priced".

**Flaws in the Theory**
- Research by Terry Odean at UC Berkeley showed individual investors underperformed the market:
  - Investors who sold a stock later bought another performed worse on average.
  - The difference was significant (3.2% per year), even considering trading costs.

**Individual Trader Performance**
- Averages hide significant variation: some did much better, many did much worse.
- Most individual traders underperformed the market as a whole.

**Active vs. Passive Investing**
- **Most active traders** had poorest results.
- **Least active investors** earned highest returns.

**Gender Differences**
- Women traded less than men and achieved better investment results.

**Institutional Traders**
- The losses of individual traders are offset by gains of financial institutions and professional investors, who profit from their mistakes.

#### The Illusion of Financial Skill in Stock Market Investment

**Research Findings on Individual Investor Behavior vs. Professional Performance**

**Individual Investor Mistakes:**
- Tend to sell "winners" (stocks that appreciated) and hold onto losers
- Predominantly influenced by recent news and attention

**Professional Investors (Fund Managers):**
- More selective in responding to news
- Few have the skill to beat the market consistently year after year
- Persistence of individual differences is low, indicating chance plays a significant role

**Mutual Fund Performance:**
- Majority underperform overall market in any given year
- Year-to-year correlation between outcomes is minimal (close to zero)
- Successful funds are often lucky, having a good roll of the dice

**Stock Picking as a Game of Chance:**
- Educated guesses in highly efficient markets are no more accurate than blind guesses.

**Research Insight:**
- Analysis of 25 anonymous wealth advisers' investment outcomes for eight consecutive years revealed that performance varied significantly from year to year, suggesting that skill plays a minimal role and luck is a major factor.

#### The Illusion of Skill in Stock Picking

**Findings from a Study on Stock Market Performance:**
* Ranking advisers based on yearly performance revealed no persistent differences in skill (average correlation = 0)
* Results similar to dice-rolling contest, not a game of skill
* Executives unaware of implications and assumed some correlation
* Culture of industry deepens illusion of individual skill
* Statistics challenging assumptions ignored or dismissed
* Personal experiences more compelling than data
* Findings from study likely overlooked.

#### The Illusion of Skill in Financial Investing

**Factors Supporting Cognitive Illusions**

**Illusion of Skill**:
- Investors, both amateur and professional, stubbornly believe they can do better than the market
- Contradicts economic theory and personal experience
- Explained by:
  - Exercising high-level skills in stock evaluation
  - Lack of skill in determining if information is already incorporated in stock price
  - Overconfidence and subjective confidence in evaluations (System 1)

**Illusion of Validity**:
- Leadership assessment tests had low validity, but this fact did not change behavior
- Similar to Müller-Lyer illusion, but cognitive illusions are more stubborn

**Factors Supporting Illusions**:
- **Subjective confidence**: a feeling, not a judgment (System 1)
- **Professional culture**: community of like-minded believers sustaining unshakable faith in propositions

#### The Illusion of Predictability in Financial Punditry

**The Illusions of Pundits**

**The Culture of the Financial Community**:
- Belief that they are among the "chosen few" who can do what others cannot

**Illusions of Forecasting Ability**:
- Tendency to construct coherent narratives of the past makes it difficult to accept the limits of forecasting ability
- Everything appears predictable in hindsight, even if not actually so
- Financial pundits exploit this illusion by offering convincing accounts of events after they occur

**The Myth of Historical Determinism**:
- The idea that large historical events are determined by luck is profoundly shocking, yet true
- Momentous events (e.g., fertilization of eggs leading to the existence of figures like Hitler) can have unpredictable consequences
- This illusion of valid prediction remains intact, even for those whose business is prediction (financial, political, etc.)

**Expert Predictions**:
- Pundits and experts genuinely believe they are offering privileged or extremely insightful information
- However, their predictions are often no better than chance due to the unpredictable nature of events

#### "Overconfidence Bias in Experts: Hedgehog vs Fox"

**Prediction Accuracy of Experts**
- **Gorbachev coup**: Uncertainty about future events
- **US involvement in Persian Gulf**: Inaccurate predictions among experts
- **Emerging markets**: Difficulty in predicting which country would succeed
- **Tetlock's study**: Over 80,000 predictions analyzed
- Experts performed worse than random chance
- Knowledge level did not significantly improve forecasting ability
- Overconfidence among experts: "know one big thing" mindset (hedgehogs)
	+ Clear and opinionated
	+ Confident in forecasts
	+ Reluctant to admit error
- Experts offered excuses for wrong predictions: timing, unforeseen events, being nearly right.

**Expert Forecasting Behavior**
- Hedgehogs: hold firm beliefs with confidence
- Clear and opinionated: good for television shows
- Resistant to admitting errors.

#### The Unpredictable Nature of Human Prediction and Decision Making

**Foxes vs. Hedgehogs: Predicting the Future**

**Foxes:**
- Complex thinkers
- Recognize many agents and forces shape reality
- Less likely to believe in one dominant force driving history (e.g., Ronald Reagan ending the Cold War)
- Poor performance in Tetlock's study but still better than hedgehogs
- Less likely to be invited for television debates

**Hedgehogs:**
- Simple thinkers
- Believe there is one dominant force or explanation for events

**Predicting the Future:**
1. **Inevitability of Errors**: The world is unpredictable, and high confidence does not guarantee accuracy.
2. Short-term trends and behaviors can be forecast with fair accuracy but long-term predictions are uncertain.
3. Performance in various situations (officer training, combat) is influenced by multiple specific factors and cannot be easily predicted based on previous behaviors or achievements.
4. Tests may have limited validity for predicting important outcomes, especially when relying on shortcuts like stock market predictions from Wall Street experts.

### 21. Intuitions Vs. Formulas

**Predictability vs. Unpredictability**
- Separating predictable from unpredictable future is yet to be determined
- **Illusory Skill**:
  - Experts may feel confident but their world may not be predictable
  - Coherent stories can give illusion of understanding the world
- **Paul Meehl's "Clinical vs. Statistical Prediction"**:
  - Reviewed studies on accuracy of clinical vs. statistical predictions
  - Clinical predictions (based on human judgment) were less accurate than statistical ones (based on formulas)
  - This provoked controversy in the field, with continued research on this topic

#### Predicting Wine Prices: Outperforming Expert Opinions Using Simple Statistical Models

**Meehl's Research on Expert Accuracy:**
- **Expansion of predicted outcomes**: medical variables (longevity, hospital stays), economic measures (business success, credit risks, career satisfaction), government assessments (foster parents, recidivism, violent behavior), miscellaneous domains (evaluation of scientific presentations, football games, future prices)
- **Significant uncertainty and unpredictability** in all these low-validity environments
- **Simple algorithms outperforming experts**: no controversy showing uniform results across diverse studies

**Orley Ashenfelter's Study on Bordeaux Wine Prices:**
- **Background:** investors buy wine in anticipation of appreciation; prices vary dramatically based on vintage and weather conditions
- **Weather factors:** summer temperatures, rainfall at harvest time, previous winter rainfall
- **Statistical formula**: accurate price forecasts years and decades into the future
- **Challenges for experts:** current prices of young wines are less accurate than the new statistical model
- **Implications:** economic theory questioned as prices should reflect all available information, including weather conditions.

#### Human Judgment Inferior to Algorithms: Context Dependency and Inconsistency

**Reasons Experts Inferior to Algorithms (Ashenfelter's Formula)**
- **Accuracy**: Ashenfelter’s formula has a correlation above .90 with actual prices
- **Complexity vs. Simplicity**: Experts try to be clever, consider complex combinations of features; simple combinations are usually better
- **Human Decision Makers vs. Formulas**
  - Human decision makers inferior to formulas in prediction
  - Humans feel they have additional information but are often wrong
  - Few circumstances where it's wise to substitute judgment for a formula
- **Broken-Leg Rule**: Disregarding the formula if new information is received (e.g., broken leg)
- **Inconsistency in Human Judgment**
  - Humans inconsistent when evaluating complex information twice
  - Experienced radiologists contradict themselves 20% of the time
  - Auditors, psychologists, managers also exhibit similar inconsistency (41 studies)
- **Unreliable Judgments**: Inconsistency makes unreliable judgments invalid predictors.

**Context Dependency of Human Mind**
- Humans influenced by unnoticed stimuli in the environment
- Influences fluctuate from moment to moment
- Brief pleasure may affect evaluation/decision making
- Context dependency causes inconsistency and unreliability in judgments
- Formulas do not suffer from these problems.

#### The Robustness of Simple Linear Models in Decision Making

**Predictive Accuracy and Decision Making**

**Importance of Predictability**:
- Predictable systems always return the same answer
- Lack of predictability lowers validity and destructs predictive accuracy

**Meehl's Research and Conclusions**:
- Maximizing predictive accuracy requires formulas, especially in low-validity environments
- Interviewing candidates for admission can diminish accuracy due to overconfidence
- Expert evaluations of wine quality may negatively impact consistency

**Dawes' Research on Improper Linear Models**:
- Multiple regression, while logical, adds little value compared to simpler formulas
- Equal weighting schemes can be as accurate as optimally weighted formulas
- Simple equally weighted formulas based on existing statistics or common sense are often good predictors

**Marital Stability Prediction**:
- Formula: **Frequency of lovemaking - Frequency of quarrels**
- Result should not be a negative number

**Implications**:
- Algorithms constructed "on the back of an envelope" can be as accurate as optimally weighted formulas
- Simple, equally weighted formulas are often sufficient and outperform expert judgment.

#### The Apgar Score: Saving Infant Lives with Checklists

**Apgar's Newborn Assessment System:**
- Obstetrician Virginia Apgar developed a system to assess newborn health based on five variables (heart rate, respiration, reflex, muscle tone, color) and three scores (0, 1, or 2) in 1953.
- The system provided standardized assessment for infants one minute after birth.
- Infant with total score above 8 was likely healthy, while those below 4 needed immediate intervention.
- Apgar's test is still used today to determine newborn health and reduce infant mortality.

**Resistance to Algorithms:**
- Clinical psychologists were resistant to Meehl's ideas due to an illusion of skill in long-term predictions.
- Clinicians often make short-term predictions during therapy sessions with success, leading them to believe in their abilities for long-term predictions as well.
- The difficulty lies in the difference between short and long-term predictions and lack of practice for long-term tasks.
- The line between what clinicians can do well and what they cannot is not always clear to them.

#### The Debate: Human Judgment vs Algorithms

**The Debate Between Clinical and Statistical Prediction**

**Experienced Clinicians' Perspective**:
- Skilled, but unaware of skill boundaries
- Dismiss statistical method as:
    - "mechanical"
    - "atomistic"
    - "additive"
    - "cut and dried"
    - "artificial"
    - "unreal"
    - "arbitrary"
    - "incomplete"
    - "dead"
    - "pedantic"
    - "fractionated"
    - "trivial"
    - "forced"
    - "static"
    - "superficial"
    - "rigid"
    - "sterile"
    - "academic"
    - "pseudoscientific"
    - "blind"
- Prefer clinical method as:
    - "dynamic"
    - "global"
    - "meaningful"
    - "holistic"
    - "subtle"
    - "sympathetic"
    - "configural"
    - "patterned"
    - "organized"
    - "rich"
    - "deep"
    - "genuine"
    - "sensitive"
    - "sophisticated"
    - "real"
    - "living"
    - "concrete"
    - "natural"
    - "true to life"
    - "understanding"

**Human vs. Machine Decisions**:
- Humans prefer decisions made by fellow humans
- Resistance to algorithms making decisions affecting humans
- Preference for "all natural" over synthetic or artificial
- Emotional intensity of mistakes matters
    - Death caused by algorithm seen as more poignant than human error

**The Ethical Dimension**:
- Unethical to rely on intuitive judgments if an algorithm is available
- Rational argument for using algorithms over human error
- Stubborn psychological reality: people's moral preferences are rooted in the cause of mistakes

#### Building Predictive Interview Methods: Lessons from Paul Meehl's "Little Book"

**The Expansion of Algorithms in Everyday Life**
- **Hostility to algorithms** may soften as their role expands
- People are accustomed to algorithms in daily life:
  - Recommendations for books or music
  - Decisions about credit limits
  - Guidelines for health ratios (e.g., cholesterol levels)
  - Sports decisions (credit for athletes, when to punt)
- The public is aware that **formulas** may outperform humans in critical sports decisions

**Learning from Meehl's Research**
- In 1955, the author was assigned to set up an interview system for the Israeli Defense Forces
- The goal was to assess **general fitness for combat** and find the best match of personality to various army branches
- The initial interview procedure was ineffective in predicting recruit success
- The author was tasked with designing a more accurate, shorter interview

**Applying Meehl's Research**
- The author had read Meehl's book, which argued that **simple, statistical rules** are superior to intuitive "clinical" judgments
- This provided the author with the confidence to apply this approach to the interview design

#### Standardizing Military Interview Process for Predictive Validity

**Lessons Learned from Meehl's Book**
- **Limit time**: focus on obtaining specific information about interviewee's life in their normal environment rather than exploring mental dynamics
- **Abandon global evaluations**: trust statistical summaries of separately evaluated attributes for higher validity

**Personality Trait Evaluation Procedure**
- Identify relevant characteristics: responsibility, sociability, masculine pride (6 characteristics)
- Compose factual questions about individual's life before enlistment
  - Number of jobs held
  - Regularity and punctuality in work or studies
  - Frequency of interactions with friends
  - Interest and participation in sports
- Evaluate each trait objectively to avoid halo effect
- Use fixed sequence for rating each trait on a five-point scale
- Focus on providing reliable measurements, leave prediction validity to formula

**Interviewer's Perspective**
- Initial resistance: displeased with focus on factual questions and being ordered around by younger interviewer
- Compromise: allowed interviewers to provide their intuitive assessment after completing the structured interview.

#### Effective Interviewing: A Disciplined Approach for Hiring Success

**Improving Selection Interviews:**
- Results showed improvement from "completely useless" to "moderately useful" with new procedure (Meehl's suggestion)
- Intuition in interviews also proved effective when combined with objective information
- Lesson: trust but don't dismiss intuitive judgment

**Implementing Effective Interview Procedures:**
- Select prerequisite traits for success in position (technical proficiency, engaging personality, reliability)
- Choose independent traits and assess them reliably
- Create a list of questions for each trait with scoring criteria (1–5 scale)
- Ensure assessment is factual and objective.

### 22. Expert Intuition When Can We Trust It

**Preparing for Effective Hiring Decisions:**
- Collect information on one trait at a time
- Avoid halo effects by scoring each trait before moving on to the next one
- Do not skip around or make impromptu decisions

**Evaluation Process:**
- Add up the six scores for each candidate
- Make final decision based on highest score, even if you prefer another candidate
- Follow this procedure for better hiring results than intuitive judgments

**The Role of Expert Intuition:**
- Replace human judgment with formulas when possible
- Criticisms in academic debates can be unproductive and hostile
- Consider adversarial collaborations to resolve disagreements
- Engage in jointly authored papers on differences, moderated by an arbiter if needed.

**Adversarial Collaboration:**
- A productive way to deal with scientific disputes
- Jointly writing a paper on differences between scholars
- Can conduct research together to find common ground.

#### Intuition and Expertise: A Balanced Approach

**Criticism of Intuition-Based Models**

**Critics' Perspective**:
- Overly concerned with failures
- Driven by artificial experiments rather than real people
- Skeptical about the value of rigid algorithms replacing human judgment
- Not impressed by Paul Meehl's model

**Gary Klein's Position**:
- Longtime critic of intuition-based models
- Argues for the importance of experienced professionals and their intuitive skills
- Emphasizes that intuition is not always misguided

**Collaboration between Klein and the Author**:
- Joined forces to map the boundary between intuition's marvels and flaws
- Aimed to answer the question: "When can you trust an experienced professional who claims to have an intuition?"
- Agreed on principles for answering this general question, despite initial disagreements
- Published a joint article titled **"Conditions for Intuitive Expertise: A Failure to Disagree"**

**Malcolm Gladwell's "Blink"**:
- Reassuring to find agreement with Klein on the book's content
- Story of art experts identifying a fake kouros sculpture as a triumph of intuition
- However, Klein and the author rejected the idea that a systematic search for cues would have failed
- Gladwell himself acknowledges massive failures of intuition, such as electing President Harding

#### Recognition-Primed Decision Making: A Model for Intuitive Decision Making in Leadership and Expertise

**Square Jawed Leader:**
- Strong and decisive image for a leader
- People voted based on appearance alone
- Intuition played a role in predictions of presidential performance

**Intuition as Recognition:**
- Shaped by early experiences
- Differing perspectives: Klein vs. Author
  * Klein: studied fireground commanders
    + Decision making through recognition and mental simulation (RPD model)
    + Applies to expertise in various domains
  * Author: influenced by observation of illusion of validity and Paul Meehl's work

**Klein's Studies:**
- Shaped by early studies of fireground commanders
- Observed decision making process
- Post-event interviews for understanding thoughts during decisions
- Commanders generated a single plausible option
- Evaluated mentally to see if it would work in the situation
- Modified or turned to next most plausible option until an acceptable course of action found

**RPD Model:**
- Applies to intuitive decision making as pattern recognition
- Combines System 1 (automatic function) and System 2 (deliberate process)
- Initial phase: tentative plan comes to mind automatically (System 1)
- Second phase: mental simulation checks if the plan will work (System 2)

**Intuition as Recognition (Herbert A. Simon):**
- Definition of intuition as recognition
- Reduces apparent magic to everyday experience of memory.

#### Acquiring Intuition and Expertise Through Repetitive Experience

**The Nature of Intuition:**
- **Intuition**: not a distinctive feature of mental life but the norm
- Quick acquisition of skills: fear and hope learning
- Emotional learning through experiences or words
- Learned fears easier to acquire than learned hopes
- Pavlov's dogs learned hope: fear conditioning
- Expertise in complex tasks requires extensive practice (10,000 hours)

**Emotional Learning:**
- Quick acquisition of emotional responses
- Fear learning through experiences or words
- Learned fears easier to acquire than learned hopes
- Emotional learning related to Pavlov's conditioning experiments

**Intuition and Expertise:**
- Intuition: quick recognition of danger or uneasiness in a situation
- Acquisition of expertise: slow development of complex skills
- High-level chess as an example: requires extensive practice (10,000 hours)
- Expertise = large collection of mini-skills

**Fear Learning:**
- Quick acquisition of fear responses
- Easily acquired through experiences or words
- Learned fears can trigger unease without conscious memory of triggering event.

#### Overcoming Illusory Confidence in Expert Intuition

**Acquiring Expertise:**
- Recognition of entire clauses vs. individual letters:
  * Good adult reader perceives entire clauses
  * Acquired ability to assemble familiar elements in a new pattern
  - Chess analogy:
    + Skilled reader can read "Jabberwocky" with perfect rhythm and intonation
    + Acquiring expertise in chess is harder than learning to read due to more pieces and complex patterns
    + After thousands of hours of practice, chess masters can read a chess situation at a glance
    + Few moves they find are strong and sometimes creative
    + Can deal with unfamiliar words and new interpretations of familiar ones.

**The Nature of Intuitive Skill:**
- Agreeing on when to trust self-confident professionals:
  * Klein: Trust true experts who know the limits of their knowledge
  * Author: Skeptical due to pseudo-experts with unfounded confidence (illusion of validity)
- Factors influencing confidence in a belief:
  * Cognitive ease and coherence
    + Confidence not reliable guide to validity
  * WYSIATI principle: mind suppresses doubt, evokes compatible ideas/information.

**Evaluating Intuitive Judgments:**
- Subjective confidence not a reliable guide to validity
- Important principle: do not trust anyone's judgment (including your own) on how much to trust it.

#### Predictive Cues and Intuition: Stable Environments for Skill Development

**Conditions for Acquiring Skills:**
- **Regular and Predictable Environment**: provides statistical regularities that can support skill development
- Chess, bridge, poker, medical professions, athletics, firefighting are examples of such environments

**Intuitions and Validity:**
- Intuitive predictions based on valid cues learned through practice: accurate and reliable
- Stock pickers and political scientists operate in a zero-validity environment: unpredictable, leading to failure
- Some environments can be "wicked" or misleading: professionals may learn the wrong lessons from experience due to lack of valid cues (like the case of the physician who contracted typhoid)

**Meehl's Clinicians:**
- Performed poorly in low-validity situations
- Best statistical algorithms outperformed humans but were not very accurate
- Lack of strong predictive cues makes intuition unreliable and may result in self-delusional beliefs or false claims.

**Feedback and Practice:**
- Skills are more easily acquired when the regularities in the environment are discovered and applied with feedback and practice.

#### The Limits of Intuitive Expertise in Professionals

**Developing Intuitive Expertise**

**Learning to Use Brakes**:
- Mastering skill of taking curves
- Gradually learned when to use accelerator vs brakes
- Curves vary, ensuring readiness for any situation
- Immediate and unambiguous feedback from comfortable turn or handling difficulties

**Harbor Pilots vs. Car Driving**:
- Conditions for learning harbor pilot skills more difficult due to long delay between actions and outcomes
- Professionals' expertise depends on quality and speed of feedback, as well as opportunity to practice

**Expertise as a Collection of Skills**:
- Experts may be highly skilled in some tasks but novice in others
- Some aspects of job are easier to learn than others

**Feedback in Psychotherapy**:
- Psychotherapists can observe immediate reactions of patients to their words and tone
- Enables development of intuitive skills to calm anger, forge confidence, and focus patient's attention
- Lack feedback on long-term outcomes and suitability of treatment approach

**Feedback in Medical Specialties**:
- Anesthesiologists benefit from good feedback due to quickly evident effects of their actions
- Radiologists obtain little information about accuracy of diagnoses and undetected pathologies

**Intuitive Skills vs. Long-Term Forecasting**:
- Experts may be skilled in short-term anticipation but not long-term forecasting
- Therapist's short-term intuition does not necessarily extend to long-term outcomes

#### Evaluating Expert Intuition: The Role of Environment and Learning History

**Intuition and Expertise**

**General Conclusion**:
- When can you trust an experienced professional's intuition?
- It is possible to distinguish intuitions that are likely to be valid from those that are likely to be bogus.
- Evaluate the environment's regularity and the expert's learning history, rather than just their confidence.

**Valid Intuitions**:
- Occur in a **regular environment** where the expert has had adequate opportunity to learn the cues.
- Result from the **associative machinery** recognizing situations and generating quick, accurate predictions/decisions.

**Invalid Intuitions**:
- Occur in an **irregular or low-validity environment**.
- Result from the expert's **heuristics of judgment**, which can produce subjectively compelling but false intuitions.
- Can occur even with high confidence, as they may answer the wrong question.

**Reasoning Behind the Conclusion**:
- Intuition is more reliable in regular environments where the expert has had adequate learning opportunities.
- In less regular environments, the expert's judgment can be dominated by their impressions of the executives, rather than the actual situation.
- Subjective confidence is not a good diagnostic of accuracy, as false judgments can also be made with high confidence.

### 23. The Outside View

**Collaboration with Amos:**
- Discussed expertise and intuition in decision making
  - Importance of considering past practice and feedback
  - Limitations of subjective confidence as indicator of accuracy

**Developing a Curriculum:**
- Designed syllabus for judgment and decision making in high schools
- Assembled team with teachers, students, and curriculum expert Seymour Fox
- Made good progress after a year of meetings

**Estimating Timeline for Textbook Completion:**
- Conducted confidential estimate exercise among team members
- Narrowly centered estimates around two years (1.5 to 2.5 years)
- Decided to use proper procedure for eliciting information from group

**Comparing Progress with Other Teams:**
- Seymour provided insights into other teams developing curricula from scratch
- Inquired about their progress when they had made similar advancements
- Learned that it took these teams significantly longer to finish textbook projects.

#### "Misjudging Project Success: The Overconfidence Effect"

**Seymour's Unforeseen Revelation**

**Seymour's Embarrassment**:
- Realized not all teams comparable to theirs finished their task
- Substantial fraction of teams failed to complete it

**Anxiety Among Team Members**:
- Never considered possibility of failing themselves
- Asked Seymour for estimates on failure rates and completion times

**Seymour's Estimates**:
- 40% of similar teams did not finish
- Completion times ranged from 7 to 10 years

**Comparing Themselves**:
- Not as good as average, but close

**Reaction to the News**:
- Collective disbelief and denial of the implications
- Statistics provided were treated as base rates, ignored
- Continued working on the project despite 40% chance of failure

**Eventual Outcome**:
- Took 8 years to complete the book

#### Distinction Between Inside & Outside Views in Forecasting

**Lessons Learned:**
- **Distinction between inside view and outside view**: Focusing on specific circumstances vs. considering external factors
- **Planning fallacy**: Underestimation of time required for project completion due to optimistic assumptions
- **Irrational perseverance**: Continuing with a failing project rather than abandoning it

**Inside View:**
- Spontaneously adopted to assess future of project
- Focused on specific circumstances
- Extrapolated from existing data
- Prone to optimistic assumptions
- Difficulty in anticipating "unknown unknowns"

**Outside View:**
- Consideration of external factors
- Accounting for various ways a plan can fail
- Importance of acknowledling the odds

**Project Completion Forecasting:**
- Initial estimates based on inside view exhibited planning fallacy
- Actual completion time significantly longer than forecasted due to unforeseen events and circumstances.

#### Cognitive Bias: Ignoring the Outside View

**Seymour's Baseline Prediction**
- Estimated base rate of success: 40% failure, 7-10 years for completion (not scientifically valid)
- Provides a reasonable anchor point for further adjustments

**The Importance of the Outside View**
- Suggests where the "ballpark" is, even if slightly off from the baseline prediction
- Can indicate that inside-view forecasts are not close to the outside view
- Disregarded by Seymour despite having relevant statistics on hand
- Common pattern: people often neglect global statistical information when making case judgments

**Pallid Statistical Information**
- Routinely discarded when incompatible with personal impressions of a case
- Experiment showed that students neglected global results learned earlier
- Seymour and his team ignored the outside view despite being exposed to it.

#### The Planning Fallacy: Overestimating Project Outcomes

**Preference for Inside View vs. Outside View:**
- **Inside view**: preferred over outside view in some cases
- Moral overtones: emphasis on uniqueness of cases can be perceived as superficial or inappropriate by outsiders
- Medical profession's ambivalence towards outside view despite evidence from evidence-based medicine
- Planning fallacy: unrealistic forecasts and plans that are closer to best-case scenarios

**Examples of Planning Fallacy:**
- Scottish Parliament building project: initial budget £40 million, ultimate cost roughly £431 million (overrun of 1027%)
- Rail projects worldwide: overestimation of passengers by an average of 106%, average cost overrun 45%
- American homeowners remodeling kitchens: expected cost $18,658, actual cost $38,769 (105% overestimation)

**Causes of Overruns:**
- Unrealistic forecasts and plans by planners and decision makers (planning fallacy)
- Contractors adding to original plans for additional profit.

#### Mitigating the Planning Fallacy: Using Outside Views for Accurate Forecasting

**The Planning Fallacy: Errors in Forecasting**

**Causes of the Planning Fallacy**:
- Customers' inability to imagine how much their wishes will escalate over time
- Initial budget errors driven by desire to get plans approved, knowing projects are rarely abandoned due to cost or completion time overruns

**Remedies for the Planning Fallacy**:
- Utilize "distributional information" from other similar ventures (the "outside view")
- **Reference class forecasting**:
  - Identify an appropriate reference class
  - Obtain statistics of the reference class
  - Use specific information to adjust the baseline prediction

**Implementation of Remedies**:
- Provide statistical information on likely overruns and underperformance for similar projects
- Decision makers need realistic assessments before approving proposals
- Organizations should reward precise execution and penalize overly optimistic plans

**Importance of Addressing the Planning Fallacy**:
- Occurs more than 30 years after the original experience
- Continues to be relevant in forecasting and decision making.

### 24. The Engine of Capitalism

**Decision Making and the Planning Fallacy**

**The Planning Fallacy**:
- Executives often fall victim to the planning fallacy when forecasting outcomes of risky projects
- This leads to:
    - Overestimation of benefits
    - Underestimation of costs
    - Ignoring potential for mistakes and miscalculations
    - Pursuing initiatives unlikely to succeed on budget, time, or returns

**The Curriculum Story**:
- The author initially thought the main point was Seymour's fallacy in estimating project outcomes
- But later realized he had also failed by not adequately considering and discussing potential problems
    - Failed to make a reasonable baseline prediction before starting the project
    - Invested resources without explicitly considering the possibility of giving up
    - Embarrassment and sunk costs made it difficult to abandon the project

#### The Blessings and Risks of an Optimistic Mindset

**The Planning Fallacy and Optimistic Bias:**

**Lethargy and Rational Thinking**:
- State described as a form of lethargy: unwillingness to think about what had happened
- Lack of further attempt at rational planning for the team

**Insights on Planning Fallacy**:
- He's taking an inside view, focus on external perspective instead
- She is victim of planning fallacy: assuming best-case scenario and overlooking potential failures
- Suppose you know nothing about a legal case: what is your baseline prediction? How many similar cases succeed/settle? What are amounts? Is this case stronger/weaker than others?
- Making additional investment due to sunk cost fallacy

**Optimistic Bias**:
- Pervasive optimism bias in our view of the world, self, and goals
- Exaggeration of ability to forecast future leads to optimistic overconfidence
- Consequences for decisions: significant cognitive bias

**Optimists vs. Others**:
- Optimism is normal but some are more optimistic than others
- Genetically endowed optimists: fortunate, popular, resilient, less prone to depression, stronger immune system, better health, longer lifespan
- Blessings of optimism offered only to mildly biased individuals who can "accentuate the positive" without losing touch with reality.

**Optimistic Individuals**:
- Play disproportionate role in shaping our lives.

#### The Optimistic Bias in Entrepreneurship

**Impactful Individuals and Optimism**
- People who influence others' lives are often **optimistic and overconfident**
- They seek challenges, take risks, and have been lucky
- Their self-confidence is reinforced by admiration from others

**The Role of Optimism in Risk Taking**
- An optimistic bias plays a significant role in voluntary risk taking
- Risk takers often underestimate odds and fail to gather sufficient information
- Confidence in future success sustains a positive mood

**Entrepreneurial Delusions**
- **Optimism** can be beneficial for entrepreneurs, even if delusional
- Survival rates for small businesses: 35% overall, 60% as perceived by entrepreneurs
- Entrepreneurs overestimate their chances of success and underestimate failure
- Persistence can be costly when based on unrealistic expectations

**The Impact of Optimism on Persistence**
- Optimistic temperament encourages persistence in the face of obstacles
- However, persistent effort despite unfavorable odds can lead to financial investment and time wastage.

#### Overconfidence and its Costly Consequences in Business Leadership

**Inventor's Assistance Program Findings:**
* Canadian organization assesses commercial prospects of inventions based on 37 criteria
* Letters grades predict failure: D and E (5 out of 411 projects reached commercialization)
* Persistence after discouraging advice common among optimistic individuals
* Overall return on private invention low, lower than stocks or high-risk securities

**Self-Employment:**
* Financial benefits mediocre compared to selling skills to employers
* Optimism widespread and costly in business

**Optimism and Overconfidence:**
* People believe they are superior to most others on desired traits
* Consequences in market: risky investments, failed mergers & acquisitions
* Hubris hypothesis: executives overestimate abilities, take excessive risks
* CEOs personally invested more at stake, take greater risks.

**Market's Role:**
* Identifies overconfident CEOs through stock market reactions
* Stock market suffers more in mergers if CEO is overly optimistic.

#### Optimism and Entrepreneurial Risk: Biases and Government Support

**Impact of Overconfident CEOs**

**Damage Caused by Overconfident CEOs**:
- Compounded when business press anoints them as celebrities
- Evidence indicates prestigious press awards to the CEO are costly to stockholders
- **Findings**:
  - Firms with award-winning CEOs subsequently underperform in terms of:
    - Stock performance
    - Operating performance
  - CEO compensation increases
  - CEOs spend more time on activities outside the company
  - CEOs are more likely to engage in earnings management

**Case Example**:
- Motel owners who used their life savings to buy a struggling motel, despite previous failures of others
- Optimistic risk taking is important for economic dynamism, but policy issues arise when government supports small businesses that may fail

**Entrepreneurial Optimism and Cognitive Biases**:
- Emotion (wishful thinking) is only part of the story
- **Cognitive biases** play an important role, notably the **System 1 feature WYSIATI** (What You See Is All There Is):
  - We focus on our goal, anchor on our plan, and neglect relevant base rates
  - Expose ourselves to the planning fallacy by focusing on what we can do rather than what others can do
  - Focus on skill over luck in explaining past and predicting future outcomes
- This leads to an **illusion of control**, where we become overly confident in our beliefs

#### Overestimation of Personal Abilities: The WYSIATI Effect

**Cognitive Bias and Self-Evaluation:**
* People often have difficulty assessing their relative standing compared to others (averages)
* Overly optimistic about moderately good abilities
* Example: "Are you better than average as a driver?" vs. "Are you a good driver"
* Evidence for cognitive bias: people readily rate themselves below average in difficult tasks
* Entrepreneurs exhibit competition neglect when focusing on their own efforts instead of market factors

**Hubris and Competition Neglect:**
* Hubris refers to excessive self-confidence or arrogance
* Not implied in quote from Disney Studios chairman
* Quote highlights the ease of focusing on own business without considering competition
* Question: "Considering what others will do, how many people will see our film?" vs. "Do we have a good film and a good organization to market it?"
* Competition neglected due to availability bias and overconfidence in abilities.

#### Overconfidence in Financial Forecasting: A Study of CFO's Ignorance and Social Psychology

**Competition Neglect and Overconfidence**

**Competition Neglect**:
- System 1 processes of WYSIATI and substitution produce both competition neglect and above-average effect
- Consequence is excess entry: more competitors enter the market than can be sustainably profitable, resulting in average outcome of a loss
- Typical entrant experiences disappointing outcome, but effect on economy as a whole could be positive
- Entrepreneurial firms that fail but signal new markets to more qualified competitors are called "optimistic martyrs" - good for the economy, bad for their investors

**Overconfidence**:
- Professionals, like CFOs of large corporations, often have no clue about short-term future of the stock market
- Correlation between their estimates and true value was slightly less than zero
- They did not appear to know that their forecasts were worthless
- Provided confidence intervals, but incidence of "surprises" (outcomes outside the interval) was 67%, over 3 times higher than expected
- Overconfidence is a manifestation of WYSIATI - we rely on available information and construct coherent story, ignoring information not readily accessible
- Calculations show CFOs should have stated much wider confidence intervals to maintain 20% surprise rate, which would have appeared ridiculous due to social psychological considerations.

#### The Risks and Benefits of Expert Overconfidence

**The Problem with Overconfidence**

**Financial Forecasting**:
- CFOs who acknowledge high uncertainty are often seen as ignorant or incompetent
- Organizations prefer overly optimistic forecasts, even if they are misleading
- This leads to risky decisions and costly consequences

**Social Pressures on Experts**:
- Experts who display high confidence are more valued than those who acknowledge uncertainty
- Inadequate appreciation of uncertainty can lead to taking risks that should be avoided

**Expert Overconfidence in Medicine**:
- Clinicians often overestimate their diagnostic accuracy
- Patients prefer doctors who appear confident, even if they are wrong

**Consequences of Overconfidence**:
- Exaggerated optimism can lead to risky decisions and paralyzing uncertainty
- Resilience in the face of setbacks is a benefit of overconfidence
- The effects on decision making are mixed, but positive for implementation

**The Role of Optimism**:
- **Optimistic explanation style** contributes to resilience by defending one's self-image
- Scientific research requires a form of optimism to be successful

### 25. Bernoullis Errors

**Overcoming Overconfident Optimism:**
* Lack of delusional sense of significance may lead to wilt under repeated small failures and rare successes for researchers (Kahneman)
* Training to state confidence intervals with imprecision: modest success reported in some cases (Geologists at Royal Dutch Shell, judges considering competing hypotheses)
* Overconfidence a direct consequence of System 1 features, not completely eliminable
* Organizations can better tame optimism than individuals
* Premortem: A proposal by Gary Klein to gather knowledgeable individuals for brief session on potential disasters after almost reaching important decisions
	+ Overcomes groupthink and unleashes imagination in a needed direction (Klein)
	+ Suppresses doubts about decision, reducing overconfidence and damage from biases (WYSIATI, uncritical optimism)

**The Premortem:**
* Gather knowledgeable individuals for brief session on potential disasters after almost reaching important decisions
* Overcomes groupthink and unleashes imagination in a needed direction
* Suppresses doubts about decision, reducing overconfidence and damage from biases.

#### Rationality vs. Human Behavior in Decision Making

**The Relationship Between Psychology and Economics**

**Bruno Frey's Essay**:
- Discussed the psychological assumptions of economic theory
- Described how economists' assumptions differ from those of psychologists
- Exposed a profound difference between the two disciplines

**Decision Making as a New Project**:
- Amos suggested studying decision making as the next project
- The authors knew little about the topic, but Amos was an expert
- They began to study people's attitudes towards risky options

**Choices Between Simple Gambles**:
- **Simple gambles** (e.g., "40% chance to win $300") were used as a model system
- Choices between simple gambles and certain outcomes provided insights into more complex decisions
- Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of all significant choices

#### Exploring Human Risk Decisions: Departing from Expected Utility Theory

**Expected Utility Theory**:
- Foundation of rational-agent model in social sciences
- Not intended as psychological model, but logic of choice based on axioms of rationality
- Example: If you prefer apple to banana, you should also prefer 10% chance of winning an apple to 10% chance of winning a banana

**Research on Human Decision Making**:
- Amos and the author studied how humans actually make risky choices, without assuming their rationality
- Engaged in careful examination of their own intuitive preferences through simple decision problems
- Examples: Choosing between tossing a coin for potential winnings vs. getting a fixed amount

**Prospect Theory**:
- Descriptive model closely modeled on utility theory, but departs from it in fundamental ways
- Goal is to document and explain systematic violations of the axioms of rationality in choices between gambles
- Submitted to **Econometrica** journal, where best papers on decision making had been published

#### Logarithmic Utility Theory in Decision-Making: Bernoulli's Framework

**Prospect Theory and Framing Effects**

**Discoveries**:
- Prospect theory turned out to be most significant work
- Established 12 facts about choices between risky options, some contradicting expected utility theory
- Constructed prospect theory as a modified version of expected utility theory

**Background**:
- Approach inspired by psychophysics
- Founder: Gustav Fechner (psychologist and mystic)
- Focus on the relation between physical quantity and subjective experience

**Fechner's Law**:
- Variations in physical quantity cause variations in psychological intensity or quality
- Logarithmic function proposed for many dimensions

**Bernoulli's Error**:
- Inconsistency between expected utility theory and actual human behavior
- Utility of wealth is logarithmic, not linear
- Proposed a new approach to the evaluation of gambles:
  - Not based on expected value (weighted average)
  - Psychological response influenced by initial amount of wealth.

#### Bernoulli's Utility Theory: Risk Aversion and Decision Making

**Bernoulli's Aversion to Risk**

**Background:**
- Bernoulli noted people prefer sure thing over uncertain prospects
- Observed dislike of risk (uncertainty) and its impact on decision making

**Utility Function**:
- People evaluate outcomes based on psychological value (utilities)
- Utility function varies with wealth: diminishing marginal utility
  - Adding 1 million to 1 million yields more utility than adding to 9 million
- Table 3 shows Bernoulli's proposed utility function for different levels of wealth

**Risk Aversion**:
- People choose sure thing over favorable gamble of equal expected value
- Diminishing marginal utility explains risk aversion
  - The more wealth, the less additional utility gained from increasing wealth

**Example: Merchant's Choice:**
- Two options with equal expected value (ducats) but different utilities due to diminishing utility of wealth
  - Gamble: utility = 47
  - Sure thing: utility > 47

**Conclusion**:
- Bernoulli used the concept of expected utility ("moral expectation") to explain risk aversion and its impact on decision making.

#### Bernoulli's Utility Theory: Limitations and Reference Dependence in Wealth Perception

**Bernoulli's Solution to Insurance and Risk Attitudes**

**Background:**
- Bernoulli offered a solution to the St. Petersburg paradox
- His analysis of risk attitudes in terms of preferences for wealth is still relevant today

**Flaws in Bernoulli's Theory:**
1. **Reference Dependence**: Happiness or utility depends on recent changes and reference points, not just absolute wealth.
2. **Different Reference Points**: Affects decision making when comparing gambles to sure things.

**Examples of Flaws:**

**Scenario 1: Jack and Jill**
- Jack and Jill have different recent changes in wealth (Jack -> 5M, Jill -> 9M)
- Bernoulli's theory assumes equal utility based on absolute wealth, but they are not equally happy
- Happiness depends on reference points

**Scenario 2: Anthony and Betty**
- Both offered a choice between a gamble and a sure thing
- Bernoulli's theory expects identical choices due to expected value (2.5M)
- But different reference points for Anthony (1M) and Betty (4M) affect decision making.

**Anthony's Perspective:**
- Currently owns 1 million
- Doubling wealth is attractive in comparison to gamble

**Betty's Perspective:**
- Currently owns 4 million
- Losing half of her wealth is awful compared to sure thing
- More likely to take chances due to bad reference point.

### 26. Prospect Theory

**Bernoulli's Model Limitations**
* **Obvious counterexamples**: Anthony and Betty's different perspectives on wealth not accounted for in Bernoulli's model
* **Risk aversion vs. risk-seeking behavior**: Explanation needed for both types of preferences within the same context
* **Theory-induced blindness**: Difficulty recognizing flaws in accepted theories, assuming missing explanation exists
* **Disbelieving is hard work** (Daniel Gilbert)

**Bernoulli's Errors**
* **Utility dependence on history of wealth**: Overlooked in Bernoulli's theory
* **Reference points**: Affect satisfaction level and utility assessment, differ between individuals
* **Alimony lawsuit example**: She prefers settlement, he wants court appearance; risk aversion vs. risk-seeking behavior

**Prospect Theory**
* Discovery of central flaw in Bernoulli's theory through luck and ignorance
* Experiments measuring utility of money using gambles with less than a dollar change.

#### Theory-Induced Blindness in Wealth Utility Assessment

**Questions Raised about Studying Wealth**
- Is it plausible to assume people evaluate gambles based on tiny differences in wealth?
- How could one hope to learn about the psychophysics of wealth by studying reactions to gains and losses of pennies?

**New Developments in Psychophysical Theory**
- Recent developments suggested that to study the subjective value of wealth, one should ask direct questions about wealth, not changes of wealth.

**Amos' Perspective**
- Amos did not dismiss the idea outright when the speaker expressed doubts.
- He recalled economist Harry Markowitz's theory that utilities were attached to changes of wealth rather than states of wealth.
- This idea seemed relevant and obvious to Amos, as it aligned with the speaker's own thoughts.

**Overcoming Theory-Induced Blindness**
- The speakers were initially unable to assess their current wealth within tens of thousands of dollars.
- The idea of deriving attitudes from small changes in wealth now seemed indefensible.

**Implications of Thinking About Outcomes as Gains and Losses**
- In utility theory, the utility of a gain is assessed by comparing the utilities of two states of wealth.
- However, this theory does not allow for the possibility that the disutility of losing $500 could be greater than the utility of winning the same amount.
- Amos and the speaker realized this blindness after they focused on changes of wealth instead of states of wealth.

#### Risk Aversion and Seeking: Losses vs Gains

**Risk Aversion vs. Risk Seeking**

**Background:**
- Study on people's preferences between gambles with high or low probabilities of winning/losing
- Initial focus: differences between gains and losses (risk aversion vs. risk seeking)

**Experiment Findings:**
1. **Problem 1**: Get $900 for sure OR 90% chance to get $1,000
   - Most people were risk averse, preferring the certain gain
2. **Problem 2**: Lose $900 for sure OR 90% chance to lose $1,000
   - Most people were risk seeking, preferring the gamble
3. **Explanation:**
   - People become risk seeking when all their options are bad
   - Negative value of a loss is greater than 90% of negative value of a larger loss
4. **Theory-induced blindness**:
   - Dominant theory did not provide plausible way to account for differing attitudes to risk for gains and losses
5. **Experiment: Problems 3 and 4**
   - Problem 3: 50% chance to win $1,000 OR get $500 for sure (Problem 3)
      * Most people preferred the certain gain of $500
   - Problem 4: 50% chance to lose $1,000 OR lose $500 for sure (Problem 4)
      * Most people preferred the gamble and were willing to take the risk
6. **Counterexample:**
   - If utility of wealth is all that matters, equivalent statements of a problem should yield identical choices
7. **Conclusion:**
   - Findings from this study provided evidence of the central error in Bernoulli's theory.

#### The Role of Reference Points in Prospect Theory and Utility Theory

**Key Concepts:**
- **Reference Point**: An important role in evaluating options
- - Higher reference point leads to different evaluation of gains/losses
- - Often ignored in utility theory

**Problems with Bernoulli's Model:**
- Too simple, lack of moving part
- Missing variable: reference point
- Need to know both wealth state and reference state in prospect theory

**Three Cognitive Features of Prospect Theory:**
1. Evaluation is relative to a neutral reference point (adaptation level)
2. Reference point can be status quo, expected outcome, or entitled outcome
3. Operates in various automatic processes of perception, judgment, and emotion
4. Essential for understanding financial outcomes
5. Characteristics of System 1 cognitive processes.

#### Loss Aversion and Decision Making: Psychological Value of Gains and Losses

**Principles Governing Value of Outcomes**

**Diminishing Sensitivity**:
- Applies to sensory dimensions and evaluation of changes in wealth
- Turning on a weak light has a large effect in a dark room
- The same increment of light may be undetectable in a brightly illuminated room
- Subjective difference between $900 and $1,000 is much smaller than the difference between $100 and $200

**Loss Aversion**:
- When directly compared or weighted against each other, losses loom larger than gains
- Evolutionary history: Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than opportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce

**Prospect Theory**:
- Illustrated by the S-shaped graph in Figure 1
- Represents diminishing sensitivity for both gains and losses
- The two curves of the S are not symmetrical
- The response to losses is stronger than the response to corresponding gains

**Mixed Prospects**:
- Many options faced in life involve a risk of loss and an opportunity for gain
- Investors, lawyers, generals, and politicians face possibilities of victory or defeat
- Problem 5: Balancing the psychological benefit of $150 against the psychological cost of losing $100
- Loss aversion is the rejection of a gamble with positive expected value due to the fear of loss

#### Understanding Loss Aversion: The Impact on Decision Making and Risk Tolerance

**Loss Aversion Ratio and Prospect Theory**

**Loss Aversion**:
- Estimated range is 1.5 to 2.5
- Some people are more loss averse than others
- Professionals in risky fields like finance are less loss averse due to reduced emotional response

**Experiment Findings**:
- Participants instructed to "think like a trader" became less loss averse
- Loss aversion tends to increase with higher stakes, but not dramatically
- Potentially ruinous or lifestyle-threatening losses have very large loss aversion coefficients

**Mixed and Bad Choices**:
- In mixed gambles, loss aversion causes extremely risk-averse choices
- In bad choices, diminishing sensitivity causes risk seeking
- Figure 10 illustrates the difference in slope for gains vs. losses due to loss aversion

**Utility of Wealth Theory**:
- Bernoulli's theory failed to account for loss aversion in small risks
- Behavioral economist Matthew Rabin proved mathematically that attempts to explain loss aversion by utility of wealth are absurd and doomed to fail
- Individuals who reject small stakes gambles will be committed to unreasonable risk aversion for larger gambles

#### Balancing Economics: Beyond Prospect Theory's Flaws

**Prospect Theory and Expected Utility**

**Background:**
- Rabin & Thaler's article challenged economics' reliance on expected utility theory
- Introduced concept of prospect theory as an alternative

**Impact:**
- Monty Python sketch inspired critique of utility of wealth as explanation for attitudes to small losses
- Economists saw this as blasphemy, but Rabin & Thaler's point is valid: rational model has limitations

**Balance:**
- Prospect theory not introduced in introductory economics texts due to central role of rationality
- Basic economic concepts are essential and difficult enough to grasp with simplified assumptions
- Keeping prospect theory out of basic texts helps students acquire foundational skills
- Differences between Humans and Econs (rational agents) become significant only in certain contexts

**Theory-Induced Blindness:**
- Flaws not limited to expected utility theory or prospect theory
- Theory-induced blindness contributes to acceptance of prospect theory as main alternative

**Assumptions and Consequences:**
- Prospect theory assumes reference point (status quo) has a value of zero
- This leads to absurd consequences when comparing prospects A, B, C:
  - **Prospect A**: One chance in a million to win $1 million
    - Value not easily comparable to other prospects
  - **Prospect B**: 90% chance to win $12, 10% chance to win nothing
    - Value less than neither gaining nor losing $12 (status quo)
  - **Prospect C**: 90% chance to win $1 million, 10% chance to win nothing
    - Value greater than neither gaining nor losing $1 million (status quo) despite identical potential winnings in both prospects C and B.

### 27. The Endowment Effect

**Prospect Theory and Utility Theory Critique**

**Limitations of Prospect Theory**:
- Cannot cope with disappointment:
  - Winning nothing is a possible outcome in all three gambles, but its value is the same (zero)
  - This does not correspond to real experience, where winning nothing is more disappointing in certain situations
- Fails to account for regret:
  - Decision makers anticipate the emotions of regret and disappointment when making choices
  - Regret theories have had less influence than prospect theory due to their complexity and lack of unique predictions

**Limitations of Utility Theory**:
- Assumes options are evaluated separately and independently, which is wrong
  - Example: Choosing between a 90% chance of winning $1 million vs. a sure $50 or $150,000
    - The potential regret of choosing the gamble and losing is greater in the second case

**Conclusion**:
- Prospect theory was accepted not because it is "true", but because its concepts (reference point and loss aversion) yielded new, predictive insights

#### "Indifference Curves and the Importance of Reference Points"

**The Endowment Effect**

**Indifference Maps**:
- Shown in Figure 11, representing an individual's utility levels for two goods (income and vacation days)
- Each point on the map specifies a combination of income and vacation days that are equally desirable (have the same utility)
- Indifference curves connect combinations of the two goods that are equally attractive

**Missing Information**:
- The figure does not show the individual's current reference point, i.e., their current income and leisure level
- This is a "Bernoulli error", as it assumes the past is irrelevant and the reference point does not matter
- In reality, the reference point is crucial to evaluating potential job offers or decisions

#### Loss Aversion's Impact on Choices in Labor Negotiations

**Labor Negotiations and Loss Aversion**
- Both sides understand the reference point is the existing contract
- Negotiations focus on mutual demands for concessions relative to that reference point

**Role of Reference Point in Bargaining:**
- Personal experience: changes are coded as pluses or minuses
- Disadvantages loom larger than advantages due to loss aversion

**Minimal Wage Example:**
- Unemployed workers accept 90% of previous wage
- Difficulty accepting changes for the worse

**Hedonic Twins Example:**
- Identical twins, current circumstances (Point 1)
- Company offers two improved positions: A ($10,000 raise) and B (extra vacation)
- Both indifferent initially, toss a coin to decide who gets which offer
- After getting used to their positions, both prefer to remain as they are when considering switching

**Prospect Theory:**
- Preference for the status quo due to loss aversion
- Changing reference points affects choices

**Albert's Experience:**
- Initially at Position 1 on graph
- Position A (raise): $10,000 gain + no loss
- Position B (vacation): 12 extra days + $10,000 salary cut
- Staying at A is preferred over moving to B due to the disadvantage of the salary cut

**Ben's Experience:**
- Identical to Albert
- Also prefers to keep current job due to loss aversion

**Implications:**
- Standard theory assumes preferences are stable over time
- Prospect theory asserts both twins will prefer to remain as they are due to loss aversion.

#### Endowment Effect: The Value of Possession Influences Pricing Decisions

**Behavioral Economics: Variation in Tastes and Loss Aversion**

**Tastes and Reference Points**:
- Tastes are not fixed
- They vary with the reference point

**Loss Aversion**:
- Disadvantages of a change loom larger than its advantages
- Induces a bias that favors the status quo
- Does not imply never preferring to change, but rather that the benefits may exceed overweighted losses

**Conventional Economics vs. Behavioral Economics**:
- Conventional economics assumes utility depends only on the current state and is not affected by history
- Behavioral economics corrects this mistake

**The Endowment Effect**:
- Origin of behavioral economics in the early 1970s
- Richard Thaler's observations of economic irrationality among professors
- Example: Professor R's reluctance to sell a $100 bottle of wine, despite having paid only $35 for it
- Owning the good appeared to increase its value

#### The Endowment Effect and Prospect Theory in Behavioral Economics

**Thaler's Discovery of Prospect Theory**

**Endowment Effect**:
- Puzzling economic phenomenon where people:
  - Do not sell items even at low prices
  - Overpay for items they already own
- Example: Professor R owns a bottle of wine, unwilling to sell it for less than $3,000 despite its market value being around $500

**Prospect Theory**:
- Provides an explanation for the endowment effect and other economic puzzles
- Suggests that the willingness to buy or sell an item depends on the reference point (whether one already owns it)
  - If they own it, they consider the pain of giving it up
  - If they don't own it, they consider the pleasure of acquiring it
- Prospect theory explains the endowment effect due to loss aversion:
  - Giving up an item is more painful than getting an equally good item is pleasurable

**Thaler's Collaboration with Amos Tversky and Herbert A. 
**Ainslie**:
- Thaler met one of their former students, obtained an early draft of prospect theory, and quickly realized it could explain the endowment effect
- Thaler spent a year at Stanford with Amos and Ainslie, learning from them and becoming friends
- Russell Sage Foundation granted Thaler a grant to spend a year with Amos, Ainslie, and Jack Knetsch in Vancouver

**Limitations of Endowment Effect**:
- Not universal:
  - People are willing to trade coins without feeling a loss
  - Merchant feels no loss when selling shoes they were holding as proxy for money
- People may experience less loss aversion when the item is not closely tied to their identity or sense of possession

#### Market Experiment: Comparing Goods Held for Exchange vs Use

**Market Transactions vs. Reluctance to Sell**
- Routine trading is not essentially different from exchanging a $5 bill for five singles
- No loss aversion on either side of commercial transactions
- Distinctive feature: Goods held "for exchange" (e.g., shoes, money) vs. goods held "for use" (e.g., wine, Super Bowl tickets, leisure time)

**Experimental Economics Methodology**
- Borrowed from Vernon Smith: Distribution of tokens for redemption
- Different redemption values to represent varying goods' value
- Public offers and responses, with price settlements being regular and predictable

**Token Trading Experiment**
- Began with rounds of token trades, replicating Smith's findings
- Tokens had no intrinsic value, only exchange value
- Theoretically predicted half of tokens would change hands

**Mug Trading Experiment**
- Introduced an attractive coffee mug for trade
- Mugs distributed randomly to participants
- Sellers had their mugs in front, buyers looked at neighbors' mugs
- Buyers used own money for acquisition
- Estimated number of trades closely matched theoretical prediction

#### Endowment Effect: Loss Aversion in Economic Decisions

**Mugs Experiment Results**:
- Average selling price was about double the average buying price
- Estimated number of trades was less than half of predicted by standard theory
- Sellers experienced reluctance to give up owned object, reflected in high prices
- Choosers and Buyers set similar cash values, with difference only due to payment requirement for Buyers
- Brain imaging showed differences in activity between Sellers and other groups:
    - Selling goods activates regions associated with loss, disgust, and pain
    - Buying at low prices is a pleasurable event
    - Ratio of Seller cash value to Chooser/Buyer cash value was about 2:1, similar to loss aversion coefficient in risky choice
- Customers' responses to price changes have been observed to be about twice as large as predicted by economic theory

**Knetsch Experiment**:
- Asked students to fill out questionnaire and rewarded them with an expensive pen or Swiss chocolate
- Allowed participants to trade their gift for the alternative
- Only about 10% opted to exchange their gift, demonstrating endowment effect.

#### Asymmetry of Selling and Buying Prices Due to Reference Points in Trading

**Ideas of Prospect Theory:**
- Reference points exist
- Losses loom larger than gains

**Observations in Real Markets:**
- Study on condo apartments in Boston during a downturn
- Owners with high reference points face higher losses
  - Set higher selling prices
  - Spend longer time trying to sell their homes
  - Eventually receive more money

**Endowment Effect:**
- Original demonstration of asymmetry between selling prices and buying prices
- Reference points are labile, especially in unusual laboratory situations
- Endowment effect can be eliminated by changing the reference point

**Trading Experience:**
- Novice traders reluctant to part with owned cards
  - Experiences disappear with trading experience
- Large effect of trading experience on endowment effect for new goods.

**Experimental Economist John List's Findings:**
- Studied trading at baseball card conventions
- Novice traders had a strong attachment to their cards
  - This reluctance eventually disappeared with trading experience
- Trading experience also influenced the endowment effect for new goods.

### 28. Bad Events

**Endowment Effect Experiments**
- **List's Chocolate Bar Study**: Inexperienced traders showed an endowment effect (18% traded) while experienced traders did not (48% traded).
- **Knetsch's Experimental Manipulations**: Endowment effect disappeared when participants had possession of goods before trading was mentioned.
- **Economists vs Psychologists Debate**: Knetsch's experimental design considered variables important to both economists and psychologists.
- **Traders' Questioning**: Traders ask "How much do I want to have that mug, compared with other things I could have instead?" - no endowment effect for Econs (rational agents).
- **Endowment Effect in the Poor**: The poor perceive money as a reduced loss rather than a gain, as they always remain below their reference point.
- **Differences Between Cultures**: Cultural differences may influence attitudes towards spending money on whims and minor luxuries, like decorated mugs.

#### Negativity Bias and Amygdala Response: The Science of Fear

**The Endowment Effect and Loss Aversion:**
* The endowment effect refers to a person's reluctance to trade an object they possess, even if another item of equal value is offered in exchange.
* Speaking of the endowment effect:
  * People are unwilling to trade even after receiving new information (example: She did not care which office she would get but became unwilling to trade after announcement).
  * Negotiations fail due to difficulty making concessions, even with something in return (losses loom larger than gains).
  * Price increases lead to decreased demand (people dislike the idea of selling for less than they paid).
* Loss aversion is significant contribution of psychology to behavioral economics:
  * People evaluate outcomes as gains and losses.
  * Losses are perceived as greater than gains, surprising some.
  * Two-systems model explains negativity dominance in the mind.

**Negativity Dominance:**
* Human brain reacts strongly to negative stimuli (threatening images) vs positive stimuli (happy faces).
* Amygdala, a "threat center" of the brain, responds intensely to threatening pictures people do not consciously recognize.
* Negative images are processed faster and more efficiently than positive ones due to neural channels bypassing visual cortex that supports conscious experience.
* Angry faces (potential threat) pop out in a crowd of happy faces but single happy face does not stand out in an angry crowd.

#### Negativity Bias in Psychology: A Focus on Threats Over Opportunities

**Brain's Mechanism for Processing Threats vs. Opportunities:**
- **Priority given to bad news**: evolutionary design to increase odds of survival
- Rapid detection of threats improves chances of reproduction
- No comparable mechanism for recognizing good news as quickly
- Brains respond quickly to symbolic threats and emotionally loaded words
- Negativity dominates positivity in many ways, e.g., emotions, parenting, feedback, self-definitions
- Importance of avoiding negative interactions over seeking positive ones
- Hardwired response to pain vs. sweetness
- Boundary between good and bad can change depending on circumstances.

**Threats and Emotional Responses:**
- Quick registration in the brain as threatening
- Symbolic representations evoke reactions similar to real events
- Negative emotions stronger than positive ones
  - Bad impressions and stereotypes form faster, more resistant to disconfirmation
- Single negative action can ruin a relationship or friendship
- Infants respond to pain as bad and sweetness as good from birth.

**Perspective of Paul Rozin:**
- Negativity dominates positivity in various ways
- Bad emotions, parents, feedback have more impact than good ones
- Long-term success in relationships depends on avoiding negative interactions over seeking positive ones.

**Gottman's Observation:**
- Stable relationship requires at least 5 to 1 ratio of good interactions to bad ones.

#### Loss Aversion and Goal Setting: Economic Implications of Avoiding Losses

**Pleasure as an Indicator of Improvement**
- Feeling of pleasure can indicate biologically significant improvement in circumstances
- Relief from discomfort is more strongly motivating than pursuit of comfort

**Loss Aversion**
- People driven more by avoiding losses than achieving gains
- Reference point can be current situation or future goal
- Aversion to not reaching a goal stronger than desire to exceed it

**Short-Term Goals vs. Long-Term Goals**
- New York cabdrivers: daily target income instead of annual target
  * Rainy days = more fares, longer hours worked
  * Mild days = fewer fares, less productive
- Economic logic suggests working more during low-productivity periods for cost savings
- Loss aversion suggests opposite behavior: more effort when resources are scarce

**Golf and Reference Points**
- Par is reference point on golf course
- Birdie (under par) = gain
- Bogey (over par) = loss
- Players try harder to avoid bogey than achieve birdie due to loss aversion effect.

#### Loss Aversion in Negotiations: Defending the Status Quo

**Loss Aversion in Golf and Negotiations:**
* Researchers analyzed 2.5 million putts to test loss aversion theory
* Players performed better when putting for par than birdie (3.6% difference)
* Tiger Woods could have improved earnings by $1M per season if he putted for birdies as well as pars
* Loss aversion influences negotiations, especially renegotiations of existing contracts
	+ Difficulty in reaching agreements due to asymmetry between gains and losses
	+ Concessions are viewed differently based on reference points
	+ Negotiators may pretend intense attachment to bargaining chips for reciprocity
* Loss aversion leads to defensive behavior and harder fight against losses compared to achieving gains.

#### Loss Aversion's Impact on Economic Transactions and Reform

**Biologist's Observation:**
- When a territory holder is challenged by a rival, the owner usually wins the contest quickly
- Applicable to institutional reforms and organizational changes (restructuring, tax code rationalization, medical cost reduction)
- Initial plans for reform often result in winners and losers
- Political influence from potential losers leads to biased outcomes favoring them
- Reforms commonly include grandfather clauses protecting current stakeholders
- Loss aversion is a conservative force favoring minimal changes from the status quo

**Loss Aversion:**
- Conservatism that keeps us stable in our neighborhood, marriage, and job
- Gravitational force holding our life together near reference point
- Studies on fairness in economic transactions
  - Unemployed professionals paid to administer telephone surveys
  - Team generated a questionnaire weekly with fish mention for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans
  - Studied public perceptions of unfair behavior by merchants, employers, and landlords
  - Overarching question: Does the opprobrium attached to unfairness impose constraints on profit seeking?
- Found that moral rules evaluating fairness draw a distinction between losses and gains
- Existing wage, price, or rent sets reference point, which is considered an entitlement not to be infringed upon
- Unfair for firms to impose losses on customers/workers relative to the reference transaction unless necessary to protect their own entitlement.

#### The Dual Entitlements of Firms and Individuals in Market Conditions

**Economic Fairness:**

**Hardware Store Example:**
- **Action**: Raised price of snow shovels from $15 to $20 after a large snowstorm
- **Standard Economic Model**: Response to increased demand and prices
- **Public Perception**: 82% considered it Unfair or Very Unfair
- **Reason**: Exploitation of market power, imposing losses on customers

**Photocopying Shop Example:**
- **Background**: Small shop in an area of high unemployment, owner reduces employee's wage to $7/hour from $9/hour
- **Previous Employee**: 83% considered it Unfair or Very Unfair
- **New Hire**: 73% considered this action Acceptable
- **Employer's Obligation**: No moral obligation to pay previous employee's wage, personal entitlement
- **Firm Profitability**: Not unfair for a firm to reduce workers' wages during falling profitability

**Rules of Fairness:**
- Defines dual entitlements for the firm and individuals it interacts with
- Firm has no obligation to share losses or profits
- Firm can transfer losses to others without being branded as unfair.

### 29. The Fourfold Pattern

**Economic Fairness and Self-Interest:**
* Identifying acceptable conduct vs. actions inviting opprobrium and punishment
* Challenge to economists' belief in self-interest and irrelevance of fairness concerns
* Published in American Economic Review despite initial skepticism

**Research Findings:**
* Support for reference-dependent fairness
* Economic significance of fairness concerns
	+ Employers: reduced productivity from violating rules
	+ Merchants: loss of sales due to unfair pricing
	+ Customers: retaliation through decreased future purchases
		- Average loss per customer: $90
		- Strongest reaction from frequent, high-price buyers
* Unfair imposition of losses can lead to punitive actions by victims or observers
* Altruistic punishment activates "pleasure centers" in the brain
* Maintenance of social order and fairness is rewarding

**Law and Administration of Justice:**
* Loss aversion and entitlements have significant impact on law
* Jurists recognized their influence since ancient times.

#### Asymmetrical Losses and Weights in Decision Making

**The Distinction Between Actual Losses and Foregone Gains in Legal Decisions**
- **Cohen and Knetsch's Study**: Sharp distinction between actual losses and foregone gains in legal decisions
  - Example: Merchant whose goods were lost in transit may be compensated for costs, but not lost profits
- **Possession is Nine-Tenths of the Law**: Confirms moral status of reference point
- **Asymmetrical Effects on Individual Well-Being**
  - Zamir's point: Distinction between restoring losses and compensating for foregone gains justified by their effects

**Speaking of Losses**
- **"This reform will not pass. Those who stand to lose will fight harder than those who stand to gain."**
- **"Each of them thinks the other's concessions are less painful. They are both wrong, of course."**
- **"They would find it easier to renegotiate the agreement if they realized the pie was actually expanding. They're not allocating losses; they are allocating gains."**
- **Rental Prices**: Tenants resist rent increases, but accept landlord's right to stay profitable

**The Fourfold Pattern of Global Evaluation**
- Assigning weights to characteristics of a complex object in a global evaluation
  - Characteristics: gas economy, comfort, appearance, etc.
  - Influence on assessment depends on weight assigned
- Conscious or deliberate weighting
- System 1 performs weighting automatically

**Changing Chances and the Expectation Principle**
- Assigning weights to outcomes of a prospect based on their probabilities (expected value)
  - Example: 20% chance to win $1,000 + 75% chance to win $100 = $275
- Bernoulli's expectation principle: Utility of a gamble is average utility of its outcomes weighted by probabilities
- Expectation principle does not correctly describe how probabilities are thought about in risky prospects.

#### Probability Weighting: Possibility and Certainty Effects

**Impact of Probability Changes on Utility**

**Examples:**
- From 0% to 5%: creates a possibility that did not exist before, significant qualitative change
- From 5% to 10% : probability doubles, but psychological value does not double
- From 60% to 65% : quantitative improvement with less impact on utility
- From 95% to 100%: certainty effect, significant qualitative change

**Possibility Effect:**
- Highly unlikely outcomes are weighted disproportionately more than their probability justifies
- People pay more for small chances of winning a large prize (lottery)

**Certainty Effect:**
- Outcomes that are almost certain have less weight than expected, despite high probability
- Example: inheriting $1 million with 95% chance vs. buying case for $910,000 outright.

**Losses:**
- Same effects apply to losses as well (gains and losses are psychologically equivalent)

**Conclusion:**
- People do not assign decision weights identical to probabilities (expectation principle)
- Improbable outcomes are overweighted: possibility effect
- Almost certain outcomes are underweighted relative to actual certainty.

#### Allais Paradox Challenges Rational Choice Theory

**The Axiomatic Version of Utility Theory**

**Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1944)**
- Introduced axiomatic version of utility theory
- Proved that any weighting of uncertain outcomes not strictly proportional to probability leads to inconsistencies and disasters
- Derived the **expectation principle** from axioms of rational choice, placing expected utility theory at core of rational agent model in economics and social sciences

**Allais's Paradox (1952)**
- Maurice Allais presented a challenge to expected utility theory
- Showed that many renowned economists violated the rules of rational choice through certainty effect

**Experiment**: Choices between urns with different probabilities and prizes

**Problem A:**
61% chance to win $520,000 vs. 63% chance to win $500,000
- Most people prefer the left-hand option (preference for more impressive difference in prize)
- Violates rational choice rules

**Problem B:**
98% chance to win $520,000 vs. 100% chance to win $500,000
- Majority chooses the right-hand option (preference for certainty)
- People are comfortable with both choices initially but logic reveals inconsistency

**Comparison of Problems A and B:**
- Urns in problem B have more favorable versions (37 white marbles replaced by red winning marbles)
- Improvement on left is superior to improvement on right in terms of potential winnings
- Preference for left-hand urn in problem A and right-hand urn in problem B is inconsistent.

#### The Allais Paradox: Prospect Theory and Decision Weights

**Certainty Effect Pattern in Decision Making**

**Overview**:
- The Certainty Effect refers to a psychological phenomenon where people place greater weight on certain outcomes compared to probabilities

**Allais Paradox**:
- A problem that challenges the rationality of human decision making as it violates utility theory
- Presented at a meeting of decision theorists, who were initially taken aback by the inconsistency with their own view of rationality

**Reactions to Allais Paradox**:
- Economists mostly ignored the problem and continued using expected utility theory
- Decision theorists took the challenge seriously and tried to rationalize the Certainty Effect
- Amos and the author aimed to develop a psychological account of the Allais Paradox

**Utility Theory vs. Human Rationality**:
- Utility theory was retained as a logic of rational choice, but people were recognized as not perfectly rational choosers

**Decision Weights and Probabilities**:
- Decision weights are not identical to probabilities, especially near the extremes:
  - **Impossible outcomes**: Decision weight = 0, Probability = 0
  - **Sure things**: Decision weight = 100%, Probability = 100%
- Departure from probabilities at low end: **Possibility effect**
  - Unlikely events are overweighted (e.g., a 2% chance has a decision weight of 8.1)

#### The Asymmetry of Risk Perception: Certainty vs Possibility Effects

**Certainty Effect vs. Possibility Effect**

**Asymmetry between Certainty and Probability:**
- **Certainty effect**: 13% reduction in utility for 2% risk of not winning prize (from 100 to 87.1)
- More salient anxiety with certain loss vs. hope for uncertain gain (financial or surgical disaster)

**Effect on Decision Making:**
- Inadequate sensitivity to intermediate probabilities (5%-95%)
  - Decision weights: only 2/3 of rationally expected range
- Neuroscientists confirm brain's response to probability variations and decision weights

**Special Case: Extremely Low or High Probabilities:**
- Difficulty assigning decision weight (ignored or overweighted)
- Examples: nuclear meltdowns, large inheritances from unknown relatives
- Human attention focuses on rare events, causing disproportionate worry

**Insensitivity to Variations in Risk among Small Probabilities:**
- Cancer risk of 0.001% vs. 0.00001% (3,000 cancers vs. 30 for US population)
- Worry not proportional to probability; probability must be brought down to zero to eliminate it

**Question:**
- Adapted from study on rationality of consumer valuations of health risks.

#### Fourfold Pattern of Prospect Theory Preferences

**Survey Findings on Parents' Willingness to Pay for Reduced Risks:**
- Parents currently using insect spray paying $10/bottle, with 15 inhalation poisonings and 15 child poisonings per 10,000 bottles
- New insecticide reduces risks by half: parents willing to pay an additional $2.38 on average (a third less than total cost) for complete elimination
- Elimination of risk premium compatible with worry psychology but not rational model

**The Fourfold Pattern:**
- Attachment to gains and losses instead of wealth
- Different decision weights assigned to outcomes compared to probabilities
- Core achievements of prospect theory:
  - People are averse to risk when considering prospects with substantial chance for large gain (top left)
    - Bernoulli discussed this effect, leading to acceptance of less than expected value
  - Possibility effect in bottom left cell explains popularity of lotteries
    - Large top prize makes ticket buyers indifferent to minuscule chance of winning
      * Dreaming pleasantly of winning adds value beyond chance
  - Insurance buying behavior represented by the bottom right cell (4th row)
    - People pay more than expected value for peace of mind and elimination of worry.

#### Risk Behavior: Loss Aversion and Decision Making

**Risk Aversion vs. Risk Seeking**

**Introduction:**
- Results for top right cell initially surprising
- Adapted thinking from risk aversion to risk seeking in losses
- Diminishing sensitivity and decision weights contributing factors

**Factors Favoring Risk Aversion (Top Row):**
1. **Diminishing Sensitivity**: larger loss more intense than expected utility
2. **Certainty Effect**: lower perceived aversiveness of gamble with high probabilities
3. **Result:** cautious behavior, reluctance to take risks for large potential losses

**Factors Favoring Risk Seeking (Bottom Row):**
1. **Diminishing Sensitivity**: larger loss less intense than expected utility
2. **Overweighting of Low Probabilities**: high probabilities have greater impact on decision making
3. **Result:** gambling for potential gains and caution for large potential losses

**Real-Life Applications:**
1. People facing bad options take desperate gambles, even if it leads to disasters
2. Businesses continuing investments in futile attempts to catch up
3. Plaintiff with a strong case: risk averse, reluctant to take small chance of getting nothing
4. Defendant with a weak case: may consider settling despite the potential loss being less intense than expected utility
5. Emotions evoked: fear of disappointment and regret vs. attraction of sure gain.

### 30. Rare Events

**Patterns of Settlement Decisions: Risk-Averse vs. Risk-Seeking**

**Background:**
- Plaintiffs and defendants make settlement decisions based on emotions, not rational expectations
- Fourfold pattern: combinations of strong/weak case and risk-averse/seeking behavior

**Strong Case for Plaintiff (Top Right Cell)**
- High probability of winning in court
- Settlement offer unlikely to be accepted
- Temptation to fight on is strong
- Emotions: repugnant loss, attractive possibility of winning
- Defendant holds stronger bargaining position

**Weak Case for Plaintiff (Bottom Left Cell)**
- Frivolous litigation with a small chance of success
- Negotiations conducted in bottom row of fourfold pattern
- Plaintiff's emotions: overweighting small chance, bold and aggressive negotiation
- Defendant wants to be safe, settling for modest amounts
- Plaintiffs with frivolous claims may obtain more generous settlements than justified statistically.

**Implications:**
- Deviations from expected value can lead to costly decisions in the long run
- Large organizations facing multiple "frivolous" suits should consider their approach carefully: settling vs. going to trial.

**Case Study (New York City):**
- 200 frivolous suits per year with a 5% chance of costing $1 million
- Settlement option: $100,000 per case
- If litigates all cases: total loss = $10 million
- If settles every case: total loss = $20 million.

#### Risk Perception and Terrorism: An Availability Cascade

**The Fourfold Pattern of Decision Making**
- Paying a premium to avoid small risks of large losses is costly in the long run
- Systematic deviations from expected value are also costly for:
    - Risk aversion
    - Risk seeking
- Consistent overweighting of improbable outcomes leads to inferior outcomes

**Examples of the Fourfold Pattern:**
1. **Settling frivolous claims to avoid a "freak loss"**: Overweighting small probabilities
2. **Refusing last-minute bus deals**: Willingness to pay for certainty
3. **Risky investments**: Continuing to incur losses in hopes of breaking even
4. **Mitigating rare risks like gas explosions**: Seeking peace of mind over cost
5. **Fear of suicide bombings**: Avoidance of buses due to emotional arousal and impulse for protective action

**Impact of Rare Events:**
- Terrorism induces an "availability cascade"
- Extremely vivid images of death/damage become highly accessible
- Emotional arousal is associative, automatic, and uncontrolled
- Produces impulses for protective actions

#### Overweighting of Unlikely Outcomes in Decision Making

**System 2 vs System 1**:
- **System 1**: Knows the probability of an event is low, but cannot turn off discomfort or desire to avoid it
- **System 1**: Cannot be sensitive to exact level of probability

**Comparison of Risk Perception**:
- Residents in City A: Told two bombers present, feel less safe than City B residents, who are told of only one bomber
- Psychology of high-prize lotteries similar to terrorism: Thrilling possibility overrides actual probability

**Prospect Theory and Overweighting**:
- Original formulation did not specify conditions for ignoring or overweighting unlikely events
- Current view influenced by research on emotions and vividness in decision making

**Overestimation and Overweighting**:
- People oversimplify:
  - **People overestimate probabilities of unlikely events**
  - **People overweight unlikely events in their decisions**
- Same psychological mechanisms involved:
  - Focused attention
  - Confirmation bias
  - Cognitive ease

#### Availability Heuristic: Judgment Bias by Focusing on Unusual Events

**Cognitive Ease and Probability Judgment:**
- Focus on plausible scenarios that conform to reality's constraints (not impossible events)
- Cognitive ease determines judgment of probability: easier scenarios are perceived as more likely
- Alternative events can become focal in confirmatory mode, leading to overestimation of rare events
  - Number and fluency of scenarios influence judgment
  - Diffuse alternatives less evocative than well-defined events

**Example:** Estimating Probability of Baby's Hospital Release:
- Focus on abnormal alternative (baby not released within normal period)
- Availability heuristic used to determine probability
- Overestimation of rare events due to selective attention and confirmation bias.

**The Effect of Confirmatory Mode:**
- Fans overestimated summed probabilities of NBA teams winning championship, exceeding 100%
- Well-defined focal events (team A winning) vs diffuse alternatives (all other teams winning)
  - Imagination and memory biased towards confirming the focal event.

#### Prospect Theory and Emotional Decision Making

**Basketball Fans' Betting Behavior**
* Focal event and its alternative were equally specific, adding up to 100% probability
* Participants bet on all eight teams despite guaranteed average loss of $127 due to overweighting

**Prospect Theory vs. Utility Theory**
* In prospect theory: decision weights and probabilities differ
* Decision weight for a 90% chance is not necessarily 90%, unlike utility theory
* Probability has less effect on decision weights in prospect theory than utility theory
* Emotional outcomes can affect valuation less sensitivity to probability

**Experiment Findings**
* "Money, Kisses, and Electric Shocks: On the Affective Psychology of Risk" study
* Valuation of gambles less sensitive to probability with emotional outcomes compared to gains or losses of cash
* Heart rate responses uncorrelated with electric shock probability in other studies
* Fear response triggered fully even if the probability of an impending shock was low.

#### Vivid Outcomes Reduce Probability Sensitivity in Decision Making

**Princeton Psychologists Challenge Conclusion on Emotion and Probability Sensitivity**

**Argument against Normalcy of Low Probability Sensitivity for Emotional Outcomes**:
- Princeton team argues that low sensitivity to probability observed for emotional outcomes is normal, except for gambles with a definite expected value (e.g., money)
- Sensitivity to probability is relatively high for these gambles because they have an expected value

**Experiment 1: Perceived Equivalence of Cash and Roses**:
- Participants assessed the cash equivalent of gambles with a 21% chance to win
- Difference in decision weights between high-probability and low-probability gambles was more pronounced for money than roses
- Princeton team argues that insensitivity to probability is not caused by emotion, as the intensity of emotion does not affect decision weights

**Experiment 2: Explicit Price Information**:
- Participants received explicit price information along with verbal description of prize
- Evaluations remained insensitive to probability even with monetary value provided
- Suggests that a rich and vivid representation of outcome reduces the role of probability in evaluation of uncertain prospects

**Hypothesis: Vivid Details Disrupt Calculation**:
- Adding irrelevant but vivid details to a monetary outcome may disrupt calculation and reduce sensitivity to probability

#### Vivid Probabilities and Decision-Making Bias

**Vivid Probabilities:**
* Cognitive ease contributes to certainty effect and probability estimation
* Vivid imagery increases decision weight of an event:
  + Enhances possibility effect
  + Contributes to denominator neglect (neglecting non-winning options)
* Experimental evidence: Urn A vs. Urn B experiment
  + Participants often choose wrongly based on vividness of winning marbles
  + Denominator neglect leads to overestimation of probability in Urn B
* Vivid imagery creates a more hopeful feeling, increasing the desire for that event to occur.
* Communicating risks: "0.001% risk" vs. "One out of 100,000":
  + The second statement calls up a vivid image of an individual child being disabled, which increases perceived probability and decreases perceived safety.

#### Impact of Statistical Format on Risk Perception

**Effects of Denominator Neglect:**
* Low-probability events more heavily weighted when described in terms of relative frequencies (how many) than abstract terms (chances, risk, probability)
* System 1 is better at dealing with individuals than categories
* Format effect is large: people may judge a disease as more dangerous if described in frequency format vs. percentage format
	+ Example: "a disease that kills 1,286 people out of every 10,000" vs. "a disease that kills 24.14% of the population"
* Format effect reduces or eliminates with direct comparison tasks that explicitly call for System 2 involvement
* Forensic psychologists and psychiatrists can also be influenced by format in which risks are expressed
	+ Example: professionals evaluating a patient's discharge were more likely to deny it when given frequency-format risk assessment
* Power of format creates opportunities for manipulation, as seen with fearmongering about violence by mentally ill individuals not taking medication.

**Implications:**
* Be aware of the influence of format on how risks are perceived and understood
* Recognize potential manipulation using format to sway public opinion or judicial decisions.

#### The Overestimation of Rare Events in Decision Making

**The Bias Toward Overestimation and Overweighting of Salient Events**

**Factors Influencing Salience**:
- Mere mention of an event
- Vividness of the description
- Format in which probability is described

**Exceptions to the Salience Effect**:
- When an erroneous theory makes an event appear impossible
- When an inability to imagine how an outcome might come about leaves one convinced it will not happen

**Choice from Experience vs. Choice from Description**:
- **Choice from experience**: Exposes participants to many trials of observing the consequences of pressing a button
- **Choice from description**: Displays verbal descriptions of the risks associated with each button

**Findings on Rare Events**:
- **Choice from description**: Yields a "possibility effect" - rare outcomes are overweighted relative to their probability
- **Choice from experience**: Never observes overweighting, and commonly underweights rare events
- The results of choice from experience suggest that people do not overweight rare events in real-world decisions

**Causes of Underweighting Rare Events**:
- Many participants have never experienced the rare event
- People can still underweight even if they have experienced the rare event

### 31. Risk Policies

**Understanding Rare Events and Prospect Theory:**

**Concept of Global Representations:**
- Based on both good and bad experiences
- Biased towards typical and recent instances
- Emotional attitude attached to representations (favoring Adele)
- Overweighting rare events if they specifically attract attention or are described explicitly

**Behavioral Economics Experiments:**
- Two buttons develop integrated personalities with emotional responses
- Conditions for ignoring or overweighting rare events better understood
- Probability of rare event often overestimated due to confirmatory bias and memory

**Rare Events and Neglect:**
- Mind not designed to get things quite right
- Familiar disasters may lead to exaggeration and overweighting, then neglect

**Decision Making: Choice from Experience vs. Risk Policies:**
- Decision (i): A vs B
  * Sure gain of $240 vs 25% chance to gain $1,000 and 75% chance to gain nothing
- Decision (ii): C vs D
  * Sure loss of $750 vs 75% chance to lose $1,000 and 25% chance to lose nothing
- These choice problems have significant implications for understanding rationality.

#### Human Preference Inconsistencies in Risk-Taking Scenarios

**Human Preferences for Gains and Losses:**

**Automatic Reactions vs. Rational Choices**
- Initial reactions to "sure gains" (A and C) = attraction / aversion
- Emotional evaluation by System 1 before expected value computation
- Most people prefer A over B, D over C
- Risk averse in gains, risk seeking in losses

**The Dominant Option Paradox:**
- Combining two decisions (A & C, A & D, etc.) leads to inconsistent preferences
- Inferior options can be favored despite obvious superiority (3% vs. 73%)
- Costly to be risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses

**Limits of Human Rationality:**
- Simple choice problems can be deconstructed into inconsistent combinations
- Preferences may not lead to optimal solutions when faced with both types of problems simultaneously.

#### "Rationality vs. Loss Aversion in Decision Making"

**Narrow vs Broad Framing**
- **Two ways to construe decisions**: narrow framing, broad framing

**Narrow Framing**:
- Sequence of two simple decisions considered separately

**Broad Framing**:
- Single comprehensive decision with four options
- Superior in cases where several decisions are contemplated together
- Longer list of 5 binary decisions yields:
  - Broad frame: single choice with 32 options
  - Narrow frame: sequence of 5 simple choices, one of the 32 broad-frame options

**Rational Consistency**:
- Ideal of logical consistency not achievable by limited mind
- Humans tend to make decisions as problems arise, even when instructed to consider them jointly
- Preferences are not magically set to be coherent

**Samuelson's Problem**:
- Paul Samuelson's analysis of a friend's intuition about a risky gamble
- Friend found playing the gamble multiple times reduces subjective risk
- Samuelson proved under certain conditions, utility maximizer would reject single gamble should also reject offer of many
- Conclusion violates common sense and rationality

**Critique**:
- Matthew Rabin and Richard Thaler point out that aggregated gamble has expected return of $5,000 with low chance of loss
- If utility theory can accommodate such foolish preference, something is wrong with it as a model of rational choice.

#### Loss Aversion and Aggregating Gambles: An Example from Samuelson's Friend

**Samuelson's Friend's Preferences (Sam)**

**Value Function**:
- Aversion to losses

**Expected Value Calculations**:
- **One Toss**: Losses multiplied by 2, expected value = 50
- **Two Tosses**: 25% chance of losing, intermediate outcome is positive, total value = $62.50
- **Three Tosses**: 37.5% chance of losing, third toss adds $62.50 to the total value, expected value = $250

**Impact of Loss Aversion**:
- Sam never wavers in his aversion to losses
- Aggregation of favorable gambles reduces the probability of losing and diminishes the impact on preferences

**Advice for Sam**:
- Consider bundling multiple favorable gambles together
- The expected value of five gambles will be $250 with a 18.75% chance of losing anything
- The mantra "you win a few, you lose a few" can help control emotional responses when losing a small gamble with positive expected value.

#### Overcoming Loss Aversion: Broad Framing in Gambling Decisions

**Gambling Strategy: Qualifications and Considerations**

**Independence of Gambles**:
- Applicable when gambles are truly independent of each other
- Does not apply to multiple investments in the same industry, as they would all be affected by the same economic conditions

**Financial Worries**:
- Not suitable for situations where a loss could cause significant worry about overall wealth
- Should not be used for long shots with low probability of winning

**Emotional Discipline**:
- Suitable for those who can maintain emotional discipline and broad framing
- Experienced traders in financial markets follow this approach daily to minimize the pain of losses

**Broad Framing**:
- Shields from the emotional impact of losses by viewing them as part of a larger portfolio
- Helps individuals avoid the "curse" of loss aversion and achieve emotional benefits

**Experimental Findings**:
- Students who were instructed to "think like a trader" and broadly frame their decisions showed reduced emotional reaction to losses and increased risk tolerance

### 32. Keeping Score

**Investing Strategies:**
- **Avoid daily investment monitoring**: reduces emotional distress and improves decision making quality
- **Quarterly reviews** sufficient for individual investors
- **Commitment to no changes**: leads to better financial performance

**Risk Management:**
- **Risk policies**: broad frames for dealing with risky choices
- Examples: highest possible deductible in insurance, no extended warranties
- Focus on long-term financial advantage over short-term losses

**Impact of Biases:**
- Exaggerated optimism and loss aversion oppose each other
- Both biases present in decision making process
- Importance of considering outside view for risk assessment.

#### Mental Accounting: Personal Finance and Self-Control Strategies

**Richard Thaler's Discussion on Decision Making**

**The Outside View with Risk Policy**:
- The combination of the outside view and a risk policy should be the goal.
- A discussion with top managers of a large company:
  - Executives were unwilling to take a risky option that could result in significant capital loss or gain.
  - CEO's perspective: "I would like all of them to accept their risks."
  - The CEO, by adopting a broad frame, could rely on statistical aggregation to mitigate overall risk.

**Risk Policies**:
- **Quote**: "Tell her to think like a trader. You win a few, you lose a few."
- **Quote**: "I decided to evaluate my portfolio only once a quarter. I am too loss averse to make sensible decisions in the face of daily price fluctuations."
- **Quote**: "They never buy extended warranties. That's their risk policy."
- **Quote**: "Each of our executives is loss averse in their domain. That's perfectly natural, but the result is that the organization is not taking enough risk."

**Keeping Score**:
- Money is often a proxy for points on a scale of self-regard and achievement.
- We carefully keep score of rewards, punishments, promises, and threats.
- This shapes our preferences and motivates our actions, like the incentives in the social environment.
- We refuse to cut losses, are biased against actions that could lead to regret, and draw an illusory distinction between omission and commission.
- The ultimate currency often has an emotional reward or punishment, creating conflicts of interest when acting on behalf of an organization.

**Mental Accounts**:
- Mental accounts come in several varieties:
  - Physical and mental accounts for money (spending, general savings, earmarked savings).
  - Hierarchy in willingness to draw on accounts for current needs.
  - Accounts used for self-control purposes (budgets, limiting consumption, increasing time spent exercising).
- **Quote**: "We hold our money in different accounts, which are sometimes physical, sometimes only mental."

#### Mental Accounting: Emotional Balance in Financial Decision-making

**Mental Accounting and Behavior**
- **Golfers' Mental Accounting**:
    - Best golfers create separate accounts for each hole
    - Don't maintain a single account for overall success
- **Illustration of Mental Accounting**:
    - Two sports fans travel 40 miles to see a basketball game
    - One paid, the other got a free ticket from a friend
    - Blizzard announced:
        - Fan who paid is more likely to brave the blizzard to see the game
        - Explained by mental accounting
- **Rational Behavior vs. Mental Accounting**:
    - Economic theory (Econ) doesn't acknowledge emotions attached to mental accounts
    - Standard economic theory assumes cost of ticket is "sunk" and can't be returned
    - Rational behavior requires awareness of counterfactual possibilities
- **Individual Investors and Mental Accounting**:
    - Sell stocks from portfolio to cover costs:
        - Blueberry Tiles: winner, gain of $5,000
        - Tiffany Motors: loser, loss of $5,000
    - Choice framed as closing an account and adding a failure/success:
        - Sell Blueberry Tiles, enjoy investment prowess
    - Formulated as choice between pleasure and pain, most will sell Blueberry Tiles

#### Disposition Effect: Emotional Bias in Stock Selling Decisions

**Finance Research Findings:**
* Preference for selling winners rather than losers: disposition effect
* Instance of narrow framing
* Investor creates mental accounts for stocks
* Rational agent should consider portfolio as a whole
* Disposition effect is costly bias
* Selling losers benefits from taxes in the U.S.
* Market anomaly: stocks with recent gains tend to continue gaining
* Expected after-tax extra return of selling Tiffany instead of Blueberry: 3.4% over next year
* Mental accounting prevails over financial common sense for most investors
* Sunk cost fallacy: investing in a losing account instead of better alternatives
* Experienced investors less susceptible to sunk-cost mistakes.

**Understanding the Disposition Effect:**
* Preference for selling winners rather than losers is an instance of narrow framing (disposition effect)
* Mental accounting leads investors to focus on gains and losses within individual accounts instead of overall portfolio performance
* Costly bias as it can result in selling potential winners while keeping losers, negatively impacting long-term wealth growth.

**Impact of Taxes:**
* In the U.S., selling losing stocks reduces taxes while selling winning ones exposes investors to taxes
* This tax advantage influences decisions made by most investors for only one month a year.

**Market Anomaly and Expected Returns:**
* Stocks with recent gains are likely to continue gaining in the short term
* Net effect: expected after-tax extra return of selling Tiffany instead of Blueberry is 3.4% over next year.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy:**
* Investing additional resources in a losing account, when better investments are available, is a sunk cost fallacy
* Rational decision maker should focus on future consequences and not justify past mistakes or investments.

#### Sunk Costs, Regret, and Decision-Making Dilemmas

**Sunk Costs and Escalation of Commitment**
- Company faces decision: invest $60 million in failing project or new opportunity
- Escalation of commitment to failing endeavors is common mistake (top-right cell of fourfold pattern)
  - Preferred over accepting loss
- Executive's personal interests may conflict with firm's objectives (agency problem)
  - Board of directors addresses this issue by replacing CEO

**Sunk Cost Fallacy**
- Keeping investment in failing project despite evidence of failure
- Mental accounts and previous decisions can cloud judgment
  - Difficulty letting go and moving on to new opportunities
- Overcome through awareness and understanding (economics/business courses)
- Regret: emotion associated with missed opportunities, self-punishment.

**Regret as a Counterfactual Emotion**
- Intense regret experienced when alternatives exist for actions taken
- Emotion triggered by availability of alternatives to reality
- Can lead to introspection, correction, and desire for do-over.

#### The Psychology of Regret: Action vs Inaction

**Effect of Unusual Events on Regret:**
- After plane crashes: stories of passengers who "shouldn't" have been on the plane (last minute seat, transferred from another airline)
- Common feature: activated imagery of normal events under similar circumstances
- Associative memory contains representation of normal world and rules
- Abnormal events attract attention and evoke regret

**Regret vs. Blame:**
- Regret: emotion dominated by personal norms
- Blame: comparison to conventional norms of reasonable behavior
- Mr. Brown (infrequent hitchhiker) feels greater regret than Mr. Smith (frequent hitchhiker)
- Regret not the same as blame

**Decision Making and Regret:**
- Decision makers anticipate potential regret
- Intuitions about regret are uniform and compelling
- Example: Paul (owned shares in A, considered switching to B but didn't) feels less regret than George (owned shares in B) despite identical situations
- People expect stronger emotional reactions to outcomes produced by action vs. inaction.

#### Default Bias and Loss Aversion in Decision Making

**Default Options and Departures from the Norm**

**The Distinction between Commission and Omission**:
- Not about difference in actions (selling a stock vs greeting a colleague)
- About the distinction between default options and deviations from the default

**Regret and Blame as Outcomes of Deviation from Default**:
- When we deviate from the default, we can easily imagine the "norm" - and the discrepancy can be source of painful emotions

**Examples**:
- **Selling a stock**: Departure from the default ("don't sell")
- **Failing to greet a colleague**: Departure from the default ("greet them")

**Default Options and Regret**:
- "Do you wish to hit?" vs "Do you wish to stand?" in blackjack:
  - Saying "yes" associated with more regret if outcome is bad
  - Suggests a "default response" of "I don't have a strong wish to do it"
  - Departure from default produces regret

**Conventional Choices and Regret**:
- Consumers prefer conventional options over unconventional when reminded of potential regret
- Managers clean up portfolios before year-end to avoid "risk of regret"

**Life-or-Death Decisions**:
- Physician's choice of treatment:
  - Normal standard of care vs unusual treatment
  - Evidence is inconclusive, but physician faces risk of regret and blame if outcome is bad
  - Success with unusual treatment less valuable than potential cost of failure

**Loss Aversion**:
- Losses are weighted about twice as much as gains in:
  - Choice between gambles
  - Endowment effect
  - Reactions to price changes
- Loss-aversion coefficient higher for more important aspects of life (e.g., health)
- Reluctance to "sell" important endowments increases when responsible for awful outcome

#### Perceived Risk and Willingness to Pay: An Economic Perspective on Parental Decisions

**Consumer Behavior Example: Disease Risk and Vaccine/Volunteer Scenario**

**Background**:
- Richard Thaler's classic on consumer behavior presents an example of willingness to pay for a vaccine vs volunteering for research.
- Individuals are faced with a 1/1,000 probability of contracting a disease that leads to quick and painless death within a week.

**Question 1: Maximum Price for Vaccine**:
- Most people are willing to pay a significant but limited amount for the vaccine, as the risk is small and it seems unreasonable to ruin themselves to avoid it.

**Question 2: Minimum Price for Volunteering**:
- In the research variation, volunteers are required to expose themselves to a 1/1,000 chance of contracting the disease.
- The fee that volunteers set is far higher than the price they were willing to pay for the vaccine.
- This is due to two features:
   - The transaction is considered illegitimate and reluctance is expressed in a higher price.
   - The individual will be responsible for the outcome if it's bad, causing regret and counterfactual thinking.

**Additional Context**:
- Survey of parents' reactions to a potentially hazardous insecticide included a question about willingness to accept increased risk.
- Parents were asked for the discount that would induce them to switch to a less expensive but less safe product.
- More than two-thirds would not purchase the new product at any price, revolted by trading safety for money.
- The minority demanded a significantly higher amount than they were willing to pay for a larger improvement in the product's safety.

**Conclusion**:
- Individuals may have incoherent and potentially damaging attitudes towards accepting increased risk, which can be harmful to their own or others' safety.

### 33. Reversals

**Protecting Children's Safety:**
- Parents have limited resources for protecting their children (time, money)
- Tradeoff between accepting minor risks vs. using resources efficiently
  - Example: Saving money on pesticide could be used for other safety measures
- Resistance to increasing risk driven by fear of regret and shame

**The Precautionary Principle:**
- Prohibits actions that might cause harm, shifting burden of proof to the action's proponent
- Costly and paralyzing when interpreted strictly
- Not a simple or compelling solution for balancing loss aversion and efficient risk management

**Emotional Pains of Regret:**
- Detrimental to individuals, policy, and society
- Fact of life that cannot be completely avoided
- Strategies to minimize regret:
  - Explicitly consider anticipation of regret before making decisions
  - Avoid hindsight bias by being thorough or casual in decision-making for long-term consequences
- People may underestimate the efficacy of psychological defenses against regret (psychological immune system)

#### Moral Judgment vs. Emotional Bias in Victim Compensation

**Keeping Score: Compensation for Victims of Violent Crimes**

**Scenarios**:
- Man lost use of right arm due to gunshot wound during a robbery
- Scenario 1: Robbery occurred in man's regular store
- Scenario 2: Man, who frequently shopped at another store, was shot there instead

**Comparison of Compensation**:
- **Joint Evaluation**: Compare both scenarios and make judgment
  - Agree on principle: Compensation should be the same in both situations
    - Location of injury is not relevant to victim compensation
- **Single Evaluation**: Participants awarded different amounts based on scenario presented
  - Man received higher compensation if shot in store he rarely visited
  - This difference due to **poignancy** (counterfactual feeling) and **regret**
    - Evoked by the thought "if only he had shopped at his regular store"
- System 1 mechanisms (substitution and intensity matching) create large differences in dollar awards when evaluated separately.

#### Preference Reversals: Impact of Single vs Joint Evaluation

**Discrepancies Between Beliefs and Emotional Reactions:**
- Contrasting alternatives that change mind absent in between-subjects mode
- WYSIATI (What You See Is What You Get And Only That) not governing emotional reactions
- Moral intuitions in different situations not internally consistent
- Preference reversals discovered in early 1970s, many reported since then

**Preference Reversals and Economics:**
- Experiment on choices between bets conducted by psychologists Lichtenstein and Slovic
- Bet A: 11/36 to win $160, 25/36 to lose $15
- Bet B: 35/36 to win $40, 1/36 to lose $10
- Safety prevails in choosing between bets, but reversals occur when evaluating individually

**Single vs. Joint Evaluation:**
- Lowest price at which you would sell a bet: determines true worth of the bet
- Selling price higher for less safe bet (preference reversal)
- Single evaluation emotionally driven by System 1, joint evaluation more careful and effortful assessment from System 2.

**Preference Reversals in Economics:**
- Occur due to salience of certain aspects of a situation being suppressed or irrelevant during single evaluation
- Emotional reactions determine single evaluations but comparison occurs in joint evaluation.

#### Challenging Rational Economics: The Preference Reversal Experiment

**Experiment on Preference Reversals**

**Background:**
- Participants unaware of inconsistency in reactions to choices
- Rational Econs not susceptible to preference reversals, challenging rational-agent model

**Interview with a Participant (1968):**
- Conducted by Sarah Lichtenstein
- Widely reported and entertaining
- Participant chooses then rejects items repeatedly

**Implications:**
- Inconsistent with preference theory
- Broad implications for economic research priorities

**Response from Economists (1974):**
- David Grether and Charles Plott publish article in American Economic Review
- First finding by experimental psychologists to attract economists' attention
- Introduced thirteen theories to explain the phenomenon
- Acknowledged that the least satisfactory hypothesis from a preference theory perspective was that individual choice depends on context.

**Impact:**
- Challenged established theoretical beliefs in economics
- Greater willingness of economists to take psychological research seriously
- Advancement of conversation across disciplines.

#### Comparing Across Categories: Judgment Ambiguity and Inconsistency

**Automatic Evaluation Processes:**
- **Categories**: Objects or events recruit their own context of comparison
- **Norms**: Exist for specific categories
- **Single Evaluations**: Consistent within same categories, but potentially incoherent across different ones
  - Example: Apples vs. Steak
    - No preference reversal within fruit category
    - Incomparable in terms of fulfilling needs
- **Associations and Impressions**:
  - Automatically evoked by questions
  - Influence evaluation processes
- **GOOD–BAD Dimension Evaluation**:
  - Dolphins have a favorable rank compared to other species
  - Implicit comparison in single evaluations.

#### The Psychology of Charitable Giving: Dolphins vs. Farmworkers

**Difficulty in Assessing Dollar Value for Charitable Contributions:**
* Automatic process of assessing dollar value: substitution and intensity matching
* Example 1: liking dolphins = "fairly large contribution" = $X
* Example 2: skin cancer in farmworkers = smaller contribution than dolphins
* Single evaluation vs. joint evaluation
	+ Single evaluation: narrow framing, allows for higher intensity score (e.g., dolphins)
	+ Joint evaluation: human vs. non-human status becomes relevant, leading to different dollar amounts
* Human vs. non-human difference not apparent in single evaluations.

#### Preference Reversal in Evaluation and Justice

**Preference Reversals and Joint Evaluation:**

**Preference reversals**:
- People show a preference for farmworkers over a likable non-human species when evaluated together (jointly)
- Examples of preference reversals:
  * Secondhand dictionaries: A vs. B
    - In single evaluation, Dictionary A is valued more highly
    - In joint evaluation, Dictionary B is superior on certain attributes and the number of entries becomes important

**Unjust Reversals in Justice**:
- Experiments with mock juries assessing punitive damages reveal inconsistencies
  * Jurors awarded more to financial loss (anchoring effect) than personal injury
  * In joint evaluation, awards to personal injury victims were more than twice as large
  * Individual victim's plight prevails over anchoring effect in joint evaluation

**Rationality and Joint Evaluation**:
- Joint evaluation is broader than single evaluation and generally serves rationality
- However, beware of context manipulation by interested parties (salespeople)

**Evalability Hypothesis**:
- The number of entries was not evaluated in single evaluation due to being non-evaluable on its own
- In joint evaluation, the significance of the attribute becomes clear and influences judgments.

### 34. Frames and Reality

**System 1 and Emotional Responses:**
- Intensity of emotional responses reflected in evaluations (System 1)
- Importance of providing context for informed assessments
- Prohibition of considering other cases for jurors assessing punitive damages
- Single evaluation favored in legal system

**Study on Incoherence in Legal System:**
- Penalties sensitive to politics and history within categories
- Large penalties for repeated violations, willful and serious ones
- Variation in fines across agencies
- Coherent within agencies but incoherent globally

**Importance of Broad Frame:**
- Comparison of cases essential for reasonable decisions
- Emotional reactions of System 1 can guide judgments in isolation
- Frames influence our understanding and decision making

**Reality and Meaning:**
- Identical truth conditions for interchangeable statements about outcomes
- Econs have reality-bound beliefs and preferences.

#### Emotional Framing and Brain Responses: The Psychology Behind Preference Differences

**Meaning: Associative Machinery vs Logical Equivalence**

**Concepts:**
- Meaning of a sentence: what happens in your associative machinery while understanding it
- Italy won, France lost: evoke different associations despite logical equivalence
- System 1 reacts differently to each sentence

**Framing Effects**: unjustified influences on beliefs and choices

**Example:**
- Gamble with 10% chance to win $95 vs. lose $5 vs. lottery ticket for $100 with no return if losing
- Majority prefers the second problem: loss framed as cost is more acceptable

**Costs vs. Losses**:
- Costs are not losses, but economically equivalent
- People respond emotionally, not rationally

**Historical Context:**
- Debate about differential pricing for credit cards: cash discount vs. surcharge
- Credit card lobby argued against making differential pricing illegal
- Cash discount more acceptable than surcharge to consumers

**Neuroscience Experiment:**
- Study on framing effects and brain response
- Combined study with recording of activity in different areas of the brain
- Subjects asked to imagine receiving various amounts of money.

#### Amygdala's Role in Framing Effects and Conflict Decisions

**Framing Experiment Findings:**
- Participants asked to choose between sure outcome and gamble on a wheel of chance
- Same objective outcomes in both frames: gain of £20 (KEEP) or loss of £30 (LOSE)
- Reality-bound individuals would respond similarly to both frames
- Human mind is not bound to reality, influenced by tendencies to approach or avoid based on framing

**Neuroeconomics:**
- Study of brain activity during decision making
- Brain regions active depend on nature of task: visual attention, emotional arousal, conflict resolution
- Regions associated with emotional arousal (amygdala) activated when choices conform to frame
- Conflict and self-control (anterior cingulate) region more active when subjects did not follow natural inclination.

**Experiment Results:**
- Three main findings:
  1. Amygdala, associated with emotional arousal, most likely active during frames conformed to choice
  2. Anterior cingulate, related to conflict and self-control, more active when subjects resisted natural inclination
  3. Brain regions "lit up" indicating increased neural activity as participants made decisions based on framing effects.

#### Framing Effects in Decision Making and Brain Activity

**Effects of Framing on Decision Making:**

**Frontal Brain Activity**:
- Rational subjects showed enhanced activity in frontal areas of brain implicated in combining emotion and reasoning
- Not all high conflict individuals were "rational"
- Reality-bound decision makers have less conflict

**Emotional Framing Experiment:**
- Physician participants given statistics on lung cancer treatments: surgery vs radiation
- Surgery riskier in short term but more effective long term
- Participants read survival rates or mortality rates
- 84% chose surgery when presented with survival rate, 50% when presented with mortality rate
- Logical equivalence transparent, but System 1 influenced by emotional words

**Framing Effects on Various Groups:**
- Medical training no defense against power of framing
- Participants in brain-imaging study had multiple trials to recognize frame effects
- Few participants managed to learn to refocus on reality-bound decision making

**Impact of Framing on Decisions**:
- Most people passively accept decision problems as they are framed
- Rarely have opportunity to discover extent of frame-bound vs reality-bound preferences.

#### Framing Effects and Inconsistent Decision Making in Public Health

**Framing Effects and Decision Making: Asian Disease Problem**

**Background:**
- Discussion based on "Asian disease problem" or framing effect
- Two alternative programs to combat unusual disease
- Version A: 200 lives saved, certain outcome
- Version B: 1/3 chance of saving 600 lives and 2/3 chance of no savings

**Choices Made:**
- Majority prefer Program A (risk averse) in "lives-saved" frame
- Majority prefer Program B (risk seeking) in "lives-lost" frame

**Implications:**
- Preferences between gambles and sure things depend on framing
- Risk aversion for positive outcomes, risk seeking for negative ones
- Framing effect established in choices about money also applies to health decisions

**Experience of Amos:**
- Presented Asian disease problem to public health professionals
- Half saw "lives-saved" version, others answered "lives-lost" question
- Professionals susceptible to framing effects
- Inconsistency acknowledged but often met with embarrassed silence.

#### Framing Effects and Moral Intuitions in Taxation Decisions

**The Intuitions of System 1 vs. System 2:**
* **Original choice based on System 1**: no moral basis, driven by immediate responses
* Saving lives has no more moral basis than keeping £20 or aversion to losing £30
* Most people's System 2 has no moral intuitions for the question
* Thomas Schelling's example of framing effect from his book "Choice and Consequence"
	+ Students' reaction: unacceptable for rich to have larger exemption, then rejected idea of childless poor paying same surcharge as rich
	+ Logically cannot reject both proposals due to frame influence on System 1
* **System 1 at work**: favors the poor when in doubt
* Surprising aspect: simple moral rule doesn't work reliably depending on how the problem is framed
* Question: How should tax code treat children of rich and poor?
	+ Dedications to reference point, not about real problem
	+ Find yourself dumbfounded due to frame influence on System 1.

#### Framing Effects and Mental Accounting in Decision Making

**Framing Effects:**
- Not all frames are equal in describing reality
- Some frames can lead to better decision making

**Different Frames, Different Outcomes**:
- Woman loses theater tickets vs. woman loses cash:
  * In the former case, respondents assume a sunk cost and may decide not to buy tickets
  * In the latter case, respondents consider only disposable wealth and make more reasonable decisions

**Importance of Frames**:
- Frames shape our perceptions and influence decision making
- Some frames can mask or distort underlying preferences, while others reveal them
- The choice of frame matters for understanding behavior and making informed decisions.

#### MPG Illusion: Misleading Frames Impacting Car Decisions and Policy Making

**Misleading Frames and Decision Making:**
* Buying new items based on frames can lead to irrational decisions (Broader frames = more rational)
* "The MPG Illusion" article by Larrick & Soll (Science, 2008)
	+ Car buyers use gas mileage as factor in decision making
	+ Misleading frame: miles per gallon (mpg)
		- Provides poor guidance for individuals and policy makers
* Example of car owners switching vehicles:
	+ Adam switches from 12 mpg to 14 mpg, saves 119 gallons
	+ Beth switches from 30 mpg to 40 mpg, saves only 83 gallons
* Intuition may be misleading due to frame's limitations
* Replace "mpg frame" with "gallons-per-mile frame" or "liters-per–100 kilometers" (used in most other countries)
* Policy implications:
	+ Misleading intuitions from mpg frame can affect both car buyers and policy makers
	+ Obama administration's new car labeling requirement includes gallons-per-mile information in small print along with mpg information in large print.
* Application of psychological science to public policy is important for correction.
* Organ donation directive on driver licenses:
	+ One frame is clearly superior to the other.

#### Organ Donation Rates: Impact of Default Options

**Organ Donation Rates Differ Significantly Among European Countries**
* Evidence shows thoughtlessness in organ donor choices: huge disparities between neighboring countries
* High-donation countries (Austria, Sweden) have an "opt out" form with 100% or 86% donations respectively
* Low-donation countries (Germany, Denmark) have an "opt in" form with only 12% and 4% donations respectively

**Causes of Differences: Framing Effects**
* High donation rates due to default option designation
* People will check the box if they've already made a decision
* Effort required for thinking about whether to check the box leads to lower donations
* Opt out form yields almost 100% donations, while opt in form elicits only a few percent.

**Formulation and Policy Implications**
* Acknowledging role of formulation in organ donation policy questions
* High societal benefit from large supply of donated organs
* Adopting high-donation default option is preferred.

### 35. Two Selves

**The Rational Agent Model vs. Skepticism:**
* Important choices influenced by inconsequential features of situations: embarrassing for rational agent model (RAM)
* RAM assumes formulation of choice does not determine preferences on significant problems
* Believers in RAM may overlook power of such factors, leading to inferior outcomes
* Skeptics question this assumption and are sensitive to the influence of inconsequential factors

**Utility:**
* Two distinct meanings: experienced utility and decision utility
* Jeremy Bentham's "Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation":
  * Introduced the term "utility" to describe experiences that govern human behavior (pain and pleasure)
* Economists use "utility" differently since last century, referring to wantability or decision utilities
* Expected utility theory focuses on rationality rules for decision utilities, not hedonic experiences.

**Implications:**
* Coincidence of experienced and decision utilities assumed in economic models with rational agents
* Believers in RAM may overlook the influence of inconsequential factors on choices due to their focus on decision utilities.

#### The Paradox of Experienced Utility and Decision Making

**Fascination with Experienced Utility vs Decision Utility**
- Puzzle proposed by author: would someone pay more to reduce number of daily painful injections from 20 to 18 vs. 6 to 4?
- Difference in decision utility not justified by experienced utility if pain intensity remains constant
- Author's observation: people would pay more for reducing 2 injections out of 6 compared to 20, which is inconsistent with the idea that experienced utility should be the criterion for assessment

**Measuring Experienced Utility**
- Francis Edgeworth's idea of a "hedonimeter": an instrument to measure pleasure or pain levels experienced by an individual at any moment
- Experienced utility varies over time, similar to temperature changes
- The total experienced utility is related to the duration of the event if intensity remains constant
- Doubling the number of injections doubles the total experienced utility.

#### Peak-End Rule: Retrospective Assessment of Pain in Colonoscopy Procedures

**Experience of Patients Undergoing Colonoscopy**

**Two Patient Profiles**:
- Patient A: Procedure lasted 8 minutes, experienced pain on a scale of 0 to 10 at various intervals
- Patient B: Procedure lasted 24 minutes, experienced pain on a scale of 0 to 10 at various intervals

**Hedonimeter Totals**:
- Measured by summing the level of pain reported for each moment during the procedure
- Used to calculate the "area under the curve" of the pain experience
- Averaged across all patients, with shortest procedure lasting 4 minutes and longest 69 minutes

**Retrospective Assessments**:
- Patients asked to rate "the total amount of pain" experienced after the procedure was over
- Intended to encourage thinking about the integral of the reported pain
- However, patients did not consider the duration of the procedure or the hedonimeter totals

**Peak-End Rule**:
- The global retrospective rating was well-predicted by the average of the level of pain at the worst moment and at the end

**Duration Neglect**:
- The duration of the procedure had no effect on the ratings of total pain

**Contrasting Measures**:
- Hedonimeter totals are duration-weighted, but retrospective assessments are insensitive to duration and weight singular moments (peak and end)

#### The Power of Memories Over Experiences: Cold-Pressor Test

**Two Objectives for Managing Patient Pain:**
1. **Reducing Peak Intensity of Pain**: This approach aims to make the procedure less painful at its worst moment.
2. **Minimizing Duration of Procedure**: Swiftly conducting the procedure to reduce overall pain experience.

**Implications for Medical Practice:**
- If memory of pain is important, focus on gradual relief and lowering peak intensity.
- If actual pain experience matters, prioritize a swift procedure despite higher peak pain intensities.

**Two Selves in Conflict:**
1. **Experiencing Self**: Determines if it hurts now.
2. **Remembering Self**: Assesses overall quality of the experience and keeps score.

**Memory vs Experience:**
- Memories shape our perception of experiences, sometimes leading to misconceptions.
- The experiencing self doesn't have a voice but its effects last only during the moment.

**The Tyranny of the Remembering Self:**
- Our decisions are based on memories rather than actual experiences.
- This can result in ignoring positive aspects or focusing solely on negative ones.

**Experiment: Cold-Hand Situation:**
- Participants place their hand in cold water and are given an option to remove it and receive a warm towel.
- The experiment demonstrates how the remembering self governs our learning from experiences.

#### Confirmation of Peak-End Rule in Pain Perception Experiment

**Experiment Design**
- Participants used free hand to control arrows on a keyboard to record pain levels
- Temperature caused moderate but tolerable pain, participants could remove hand at any time
- Two cold-hand episodes: short (60 seconds) and long (90 seconds)
  - Short episode: water at 14°C, ended with warm towel
  - Long episode: first 60 seconds identical to short, then slightly warmer water for next 30 seconds
- Participants underwent three trials but only experienced two (short and long), separated by 7 minutes
- After second trial, participants were given choice to repeat short or long experience

**Experience vs. Memory**
- Experiencing self found long trial worse due to prolonged pain
- Remembering self's opinion unknown beforehand
- Peak-end rule predicts better memory for long trial due to decreasing pain intensity
- Duration neglect predicts ignoring difference between 90 seconds and 60 seconds of pain

**Results**
- Majority (80%) of participants preferred repeating long trial, despite it being longer and having a greater initial intensity
- Participants who chose long trial did so unintentionally, not due to masochistic tendencies.

#### "Memory Bias and Preference: Less is More Effect"

**Experimental Findings**
- In cold-hand experiment: subjects chose less aversive memory based on peak moment or end, not total duration (contradicting objective evaluation)
- Less is more effect observed in this and previous studies, e.g., Hsee's study about adding dishes and feminist bank teller example
- System 1 represents sets by averages, norms, prototypes instead of sums, leading to discrepancy between decision utility and experienced utility

**Memory Storage**
- Remembering self stores memories as representative moments, strongly influenced by peak and end
- Objective observer evaluates episodes based on integral or sum of pain/pleasure over time
- Evolution may have designed animals' memory to store integrals for essential functions like food storage

**Pleasure and Pain**
- Rats exhibit duration neglect for both pleasure and pain: duration has little effect on fear or eagerness to obtain it
- Intensity is the main factor in rat studies, same as for electric stimulation of specific brain areas

**Biology vs. Rationality**
- Rules governing the remembering self have a long evolutionary history
- Biological functions may require memory storage of integrals, while less significant for pain/pleasure response.

### 36. Life as a Story

**The Most Useful Idea in Measuring Utility of Injections**
- Equally painful injections can be measured by counting them
- If all injections are equally aversive:
    - 20 injections are twice as bad as 10
    - Reduction from 20 to 18 and 6 to 4 have equal value
- Decision utility may not correspond to experienced utility, indicating an issue with the decision

**The Cold-Hand Experiment**
- An episode of pain that lasts 90 seconds is worse than the first 60 seconds
- If people willingly choose to endure the longer episode, something is wrong with their decision
- Discrepancy between decision and experience originates from:
    - **Diminishing sensitivity**: Difference between 18 and 20 less impressive than 6 and 4
    - **Duration neglect** and **peak-end rule**: Memories can be wrong, not attuned to experiences

**Challenges to Rationality of Choice**
- Personal experiences and memories shape tastes and decisions
- Inconsistencies in preferences and maximizing interests
- Memory's representation of the most intense moment (peak) and end feelings may not serve our preference for brief pleasures and long pains

**Thinking About Past Experiences**
- **Duration neglect**: Giving equal weight to good and bad parts, even if good part lasted much longer
- Considering past experiences from the perspective of the "remembering self" vs. the actual experience

#### The Role of Narrative in Memory and Life Evaluation

**Key Points:**

**The Significance of Last Moments**
- In opera, the tension builds as the young lover races to see Violetta before she dies
- Importance lies not in duration but in significant events
- Narratives define endings and characters' lives

**Duration Neglect**
- Normal in storytelling
- Memories composed of memorable moments
- Endings often shape narrative character

**The Role of Narrative in Our Lives**
- We care about how stories unfold, not just feelings
- Caring for others involves concern for their narratives
- Pity can be felt even for events that change stories of the deceased

**Evaluating Lives: The Peak-End Rule and Duration Neglect**
- Study on Jen's life story
  - Jen died instantly, leaving behind a happy life or an unfulfilling one
  - Participants evaluated her life based on duration neglected, focusing on peak experiences and end result.

#### Duration Neglect in Life Evaluation: A Peak-End Effect

**Findings from a Study on Life Desirability and Happiness:**
* Participants rated Jen's life as pleasant but less desirable after reading her biography
* Duration neglected: adding years had no effect on life desirability or total happiness judgments
* Peak-end effect: happiness based on typical periods in a lifetime, not sum of happiness over duration
* Less is more effect: slight drop in evaluations for happier lives with added unhappy years
* Intuitive evaluation of entire lives and brief episodes focuses on progressive experience and end feelings.

**Effects of Labor and Vacations:**
* Duration matters due to changing quality of experience during longer episodes
* Mother's depletion after 24 hours vs. 6 hours, vacationer's rest after 6 days vs. 3 days
* What truly matters is how the person feels at the end of each episode.

### 37. Experienced Well-Being

**Vacations: Relaxation vs. Memories**

**Relaxing Vacations vs. Memory Construction**
- Resorts offer relaxation
- Tourism focuses on constructing memories
- Importance of vacation memories shapes experience
- Photography as a tool for future memory design

**Impact on Enjoyment and Choices**
- Goals: relaxation or memory creation
- Vacation evaluation based on future memories
- Memorable experiences gain significance
- Intention to repeat determined by final evaluation

**The Role of the Remembering Self vs. Experiencing Self**
- Choices based on past experiences (memory)
- Thought experiment: wiping out memories during vacation
  - Reduces value for some people
  - Maximizing overall pleasure for others
  - Reveals priorities: experiencing self vs. remembering self

**Considerations in Vacation Planning**
- Elimination of memories reduces vacation's value for some
- Treatment of vacation based on personal preferences and priorities.

#### Perception of Well-being: The Experiencing vs Remembering Self

**Thought Experiment: Painful Operation and Amnesia**
- Most people are remarkably indifferent to the pains of their experiencing self
- Some people don't care at all about the suffering of their own self
- Others pity their suffering self, but not more than a stranger in pain
- The "experiencing self" is like a stranger to the "remembering self"

**Well-Being: Experienced vs. Remembered**
- **Global satisfaction with life** is a valid measure of well-being for some, but not all
- Researcher focused on the well-being of the **experiencing self**, not just the remembering self
- Proposed definition of "happiness" in terms of activities continued vs. stopped, and neutral states
- Examples of activities people would rather continue than stop: mental and physical pleasures, total absorption in a task (flow)

#### Day Reconstruction Method for Measuring Experienced Well-Being

**Well-Being Measurement: Dream Team and Method Development**

**Background:**
- Resistance to interruption indicates a good time was had during toys and swings
- Evaluate well-being profile of experiencing self, not just remembering self (Hedonimeter method)

**Team Formation:**
- Assembled dream team of psychologists and economist for measure development

**Method Development: Experience Sampling vs Day Reconstruction Method (DRM)**

**Experience Sampling:**
- Random beeps/vibrations on phone, answer questions about current experience and feelings
- Expensive and burdensome but less disturbing than expected

**Day Reconstruction Method (DRM):**
- Participants relive previous day in detail, break it up into episodes
- Select activities, list individuals they were with, rate intensity of several feelings on 0–6 scales.

**Validity:**
- Validated through several comparisons with experience sampling.
- People able to retrieve a past situation in detail can relive the associated feelings accurately.

#### "U-index: Measuring Emotional Pain and Its Impact on Daily Life"

**Study on Emotional Well-being and Life Satisfaction:**
* Participants reported times of waking day episodes, allowing for calculation of duration-weighted measure of daily affect
* Longer episodes carried more weight in assessment of emotional state
* Questionnaire included measures of life satisfaction (satisfaction of the remembering self)
* Research used Dynamic Regulation Model (DRM) to study determinants of emotional well-being and life satisfaction in women from US, France, Denmark

**Emotional States:**
* Moments not easily represented by single happiness value
* Positive emotions: love, joy, engagement, hope, amusement
* Negative emotions: anger, shame, depression, loneliness
* Objective measurement using U-index (unpleasant state percentage)
	+ Individuals spending 4 hours out of 16 hour day in unpleasant state = 25% U-index
	+ Decrease from 20% to 18% indicates population spends less time in emotional discomfort or pain
* Inequality in distribution of emotional pain observed, with some individuals experiencing considerable distress for much of the day

**U-Index and Activities:**
* Can be computed for various activities: commuting, work, child care, housework, socializing, TV watching, sex
* Higher U-index for certain activities (morning commute: 29%, work: 27%, child care: 24%) compared to others (housework: 18%, socializing: 12%, TV watching: 12%, sex: 5%)
* Weekends had lower U-index than weekdays due to less time spent on disliked activities and reduced tension/stress from work.

#### The Impact of Situational Factors on Happiness and Mood

**Emotional Well-Being: Insights from Time Use Surveys**

**Surprising Findings about Emotional Experience**:
- American women found time spent with children slightly less enjoyable than doing housework
- Frenchwomen spend less time with their children but enjoy it more, possibly due to access to child care and fewer activities

**Mood Fluctuations**:
- Mood at any moment depends on temperament, overall happiness, situational factors (e.g., work environment)
- Emotional state is largely determined by what we attend to
- Recurring thoughts can dominate subjective experience over immediate situation

**Implications for Individuals and Society**:
- Controlling one's time use can improve emotional well-being
- Switching from passive leisure (e.g., TV) to active forms of leisure (socializing, exercise) can enhance positive experiences
- Social policies that address transportation, child care, and socializing opportunities for certain demographics may reduce "U-index" and increase overall well-being

**Measuring Well-Being**:
- National surveys on time use and experienced well-being can inform social policy
- The Gallup World Poll measures emotions experienced the previous day through a self-anchoring striving scale
- Comparison of daily experiences and life evaluation reveals the importance of social contacts, physical health in well-being.

### 38. Thinking About Life

**Evaluating Life Satisfaction: Factors Affecting Well-Being**

**Impact of Education**:
- More education associated with higher life evaluation
- No greater experienced well-being for the more educated
- Tends to report higher stress in the U.S.

**Effectiveness of Religion and Spirituality**:
- Positive impact on both positive affect and stress reduction
- No reduction of feelings of depression or worry

**Wealth vs. Happiness**:
- **Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index**: Poor individuals report higher misery, rich have increased life satisfaction but no improvement in experienced well-being
- Severe poverty amplifies the effects of other misfortunes (illness, divorce, loneliness) for the very poor

**Weekend Effects and Satiation Point**:
- Higher income beyond $75,000 (in high-cost areas) does not increase experienced well-being
- Reduced ability to enjoy small pleasures for those with higher income

**Additional Findings**:
- Educational attainment has more impact on life evaluation than experienced well-being
- Ill health has a significant adverse effect on experienced well-being compared to life evaluation
- Living with children imposes a cost in terms of daily feelings (stress, anger) but has smaller effects on life evaluation

#### Marriage and Life Satisfaction: A Cognitive Perspective

**Contrast Between Income and Well-Being:**
* Higher income leads to higher satisfaction for life beyond point of positive effect on experience (source: German Socio-Economic Panel)
* Life satisfaction is different from experienced well-being, not a flawed measure (Andrew Clark, Ed Diener, Yannis Georgellis)

**Marriage and Affective Forecasting:**
* Decision to get married may reflect error of affective forecasting for some people
* Nervousness about future happiness due to high rate of divorce and marital disappointment (Daniel Gilbert, Timothy Wilson)
* Steep decline in life satisfaction after marriage seen as adaptation or heuristics of judgment.

**Evaluating Life Satisfaction:**
* Questioning the ease with which people answer questions regarding their life satisfaction
* Some may have ready-made answers from previous evaluations
* Majority might substitute answers to simpler questions for ease (Andrew Clark, Ed Diener, Yannis Georgellis)
* Heuristics of judgment: considering how respondents evaluate their lives quickly and accurately.

#### The Short-Term Impact of Life Events on Happiness

**The Limitations of Global Life Satisfaction Evaluations**

**Mood Heuristic**:
- Responses to global well-being questions are influenced by current mood
- Experiments have demonstrated this influence (e.g., students reporting increased happiness after finding a dime)

**Selective Attention**:
- Responses to global well-being questions are determined by the ideas that come to mind
- Not all relevant domains of life are considered equally
- Significant events, concerns, and achievements/failures are more likely to be remembered

**Temporal Novelty and Adaptation**:
- Recent or upcoming events (e.g., marriage) can temporarily increase reported life satisfaction
- This "surge" in happiness may not reflect actual well-being or adaptation process
- Over time, novelty wanes, and well-being depends on current environment and activities

#### Long-Term Impact of Youthful Financial Goals on Adult Life Satisfaction

**Impact of Marriage on Experienced Well-Being**

**Findings**:
- No overall difference in experienced well-being between women who lived with a mate and those who did not.
- Reasons for this finding lie in how each group uses their time.

**Women with Mates vs. Without Mates**:
- Women with mates spend less time alone, but also:
  - Less time with friends
  - More time making love
  - More time on housework, food preparation, and child care
  - More time with their husband (beneficial for some, not all)

**Factors Affecting Well-Being**:
- Experienced well-being is influenced by genetics of temperament as much as height or intelligence.
- Individuals in similar circumstances vary greatly in happiness.

**Balancing Effects**:
- Some people find benefits in situations others dislike (e.g., marriage, new circumstances)
- Correlations with well-being are low because positive and negative effects cancel each other out.

**Impact of Goals on Life Satisfaction**:
- Higher education study showed long-term effects of goals set in youth.
  - Participants rated importance of "being very well-off financially" on a scale.
  - Those who placed more emphasis on money had higher income and greater life satisfaction as adults.

**Conclusion**:
- Goals play a significant role in determining life satisfaction.

#### The Focusing Illusion: Life Evaluations and Heuristics

**Findings on Goals and Well-Being:**
* People's goals influence their well-being significantly
* Difficult to attain goals may lead to dissatisfaction (e.g., becoming accomplished in a performing art)
* Teenagers' goals impact their future satisfaction levels
* Exclusive focus on experienced well-being is not sufficient; both goals and feelings must be considered

**The Focusing Illusion:**
* People use heuristics when evaluating their lives (substitution and WYSIATI)
* Focusing on a particular aspect can create an illusion that it holds more importance than it does in reality
* The focusing illusion: Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.

**Background:**
* Debate with wife about moving from California to Princeton and its impact on well-being
* Intuitions about happiness influenced by climate can be errors of affective forecasting
* Observation that permanent life circumstances have little effect on well-being.

#### Focusing Illusion: Overvaluing Climate in Life Satisfaction

**Impact of Climate on Well-Being: A Misconception Debunked**

**Background:**
- Discussion about forecasting happiness on a warmer planet based on California experience
- Personal argument that climate is not the only determinant of well-being
- Grant funded research to study happiness in Californians vs. Midwesterners

**Findings:**
1. **Californians and Midwesterners hold similar beliefs**: Both groups believe Californians are happier due to their climate, an illusion called WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)
2. **Importance of climate overestimated**: Climate was not a significant factor in determining well-being as reported by students from both regions
3. **Focusing illusion:** People tend to focus too much on one factor while neglecting others, leading to an incorrect assessment of its importance
4. **Misconceptions about car pleasure**: Similar focusing illusion occurs when evaluating personal enjoyment of a car or other objects
5. **Impact of long-term residency**: Long-term Californians may take their climate for granted and overlook it when assessing their overall well-being
6. **Implications:** The focusing illusion can mislead individuals in various situations, emphasizing the need for a holistic perspective.

#### Adapting to Long-Term Circumstances: Paraplegia as an Example

**The Focusing Illusion and Adaptation to Life Circumstances**

**Contrast and Salience**:
- People are more likely to focus on salient aspects of life when a contrasting alternative is highly available
- Example: Someone who moved from Ohio to California may initially have distorted perceptions due to the comparison between climates

**The Focusing Illusion**:
- Can cause people to be wrong about their current state of well-being, that of others, and their own future happiness

**Adaptation to New Situations**:
- Attention is withdrawn from a new situation as it becomes more familiar
- Exceptions: Chronic pain, constant exposure to loud noise, and severe depression
- Paraplegics are generally in a fairly good mood most of the time after their accident, with few exceptions

**Research Findings**:
- Most long-term circumstances of life (e.g., paraplegia, marriage) are experienced as "part-time" states that people inhabit only when they actively engage with them
- A survey showed that respondents' estimates of the proportion of time paraplegics spend in a bad mood were influenced by whether the accident was recently (1 month) or remotely (1 year) perceived.

### Conclusions

**Mood Estimates of Paraplegics:**
* Group 1: Those who knew a paraplegic
	+ Estimated 75% bad mood (recent)
	+ Estimated 41% bad mood (after 1 year)
* Group 2: Those who had to imagine a paraplegic
	+ Estimated 70% bad mood (recent)
	+ Estimated 68% bad mood (after 1 year)

**Differences between Groups:**
- Knowledge of Paraplegics: Group 1 observed gradual adaptation, Group 2 did not
- Judgments about mood after accidents: Group 1 underestimated long-term bad mood for paraplegics, Group 2 overestimated it.

**Life Satisfaction and Chronic Conditions:**
* Recent studies on colostomy patients showed inconsistencies between experienced well-being and self-evaluations of lives
* Experience sampling shows no difference in experienced happiness between these patients and healthy population
* Colostomy patients would trade years for shorter life without the condition
* Patients whose colostomy has been reversed remember it as awful, despite comfortable experience.

**Miswanting:**
- Daniel Gilbert and Timothy Wilson introduced "miswanting" to describe bad choices from errors of affective forecasting
- Focusing illusion (focalism) is a source of miswanting
- It makes us prone to exaggerate the effect of significant purchases or changed circumstances on future well-being.

**Comparing Two Commitments:**
* Buying a new car vs joining a social group
* Novelty of experiences will eventually fade, but attention will remain for social interactions
* Focusing illusion creates bias in favor of goods and experiences that are initially exciting.

#### Understanding Human Happiness: Time, Affective Forecasting, and Miswanting

**The Role of Time**
- The life of the experiencing self can be described as a series of moments, each with a value
- However, the **remembering self** represents episodes differently:
  - Focuses on critical moments (beginning, peak, end)
  - Neglects duration
- This is seen in:
  - The "cold-hand situation"
  - Violetta's story
- Also apparent in **prospect theory**:
  - A state represented by the transition to it, rather than its duration
  - Decision utility corresponds to the anticipated intensity of the reaction
- Similar neglect of time and adaptation found in forecasts of chronic diseases and the "focusing illusion"
- The mistake is a focus on selected moments and neglect of other times
- **The mind** is good at stories but not well-designed for processing time

**Progress in Understanding Happiness**
- We have learned that the term **"happiness"** does not have a simple meaning
- The word should not be used as if it does
- Sometimes scientific progress leaves us more puzzled than before

**Conclusions**
- The author introduced two fictional characters:
  - The **intuitive System 1**, which does the fast thinking
  - The effortful and slower **System 2**, which does the slow thinking and maintains control
- These were also compared to:
  - The fictitious Econs, who live in theory land
  - The real-world Humans

#### The Two Selves: Experiencing vs Remembering Self and Decision Making Bias

**The Two Selves**

**Two Distinctive Selves:**
- Experiencing self: does the living
- Remembering self: keeps score and makes choices

**Duration Neglect and Peak-End Rule**:
- Harder problem than initially thought
- Cold-hand study example:
  - Choices were manifestly absurd
  - Resulted from duration neglect and peak-end rule
  - Preference for better memory, even with more pain

**Evaluation of Episodes and Lives:**
- Duration neglected in evaluations
- Peak-end rule applied in judgments
  - Last moments given greater weight
  - Long periods of moderate happiness vs. short intense joy

**Duration Neglect Bias**:
- Favors short period of intense joy over long period of moderate happiness
- Also makes us fear a short period of tolerable suffering more than long period of moderate pain
- Causes us to accept long periods of mild unpleasantness if ending will be better

**Regret and Advice**:
- Remembering self's perspective not always correct
- Objective observer might offer different advice, prioritizing experiencing self's interests.

#### The Misalignment of Perceived and Actual Well-being

**The Remembering Self vs. The Experiencing Self**

**Distortions of the Remembering Self:**
- Neglects duration
- Emphasizes peaks and ends
- Susceptible to hindsight
- Yields distorted reflections of actual experience

**Duration-Weighted Well-Being:**
- Treats all moments alike, memorable or not
- Moments gain weight based on importance or memorability
- Memorable moments' duration includes time spent dwelling on them
- Important moments may alter subsequent experiences

**Limitations of Duration Weighting:**
- Individuals identify with their remembering self
- People care about their story and what they want
- Cannot be a complete theory of well-being without considering both selves

**Philosophical Implications:**
- Importance of both the remembering self and experiencing self
- Disagreements on which self matters more for policies in various domains (medicine, welfare)
- Complex issue with no easy solution needed to be addressed by philosophers and policymakers.

**Government Policies:**
- Recent interest in using measures of well-being as indicators
- Possibility of including an index of suffering in national statistics
- Importance of considering both the remembering self and experiencing self when making decisions.

#### "Human Decision Making: Coherence vs. Reasonability in Economics"

**The Concept of Rationality**
- **Reasonable**: Beliefs aligned with reality, preferences consistent with interests and values
- **Rational**: Logical coherence, internal consistency
- Economists define rationality as internal consistency, not reasonableness

**Econs vs Humans**
- Econs: Rational by definition (logically consistent)
- Humans: Not internally consistent, but not irrational
  - Susceptible to cognitive biases and inconsistencies (priming, WYSIATI, narrow framing, inside view, preference reversals)
  - Cannot fully implement logical rules due to finite mind

**Reasonableness vs Rationality**
- Reasonable: Moderate, sane, capable of reasoning
- Rational: Logically consistent, coherent

**Controversy around Human Rationality**
- Faith in human rationality linked to libertarian ideology
  - Individuals should be free to choose, no interference unless harming others
- Chicago school economics argues against protecting choices that are not irrational
- Admiration for market efficiency in allocating goods

**Misconceptions about Human Rationality**
- Research shows Humans are not well described by the rational-agent model
- Irrationality does not equal impulsivity or emotionality
- Demonstration of inconsistencies does not equate to irrational choices.

#### Liberty vs. Paternalism: Balancing Freedom and Decision-Making Support

**Behavioral Economics vs. Rational Choice Theory: A Debate**

**Gary Becker's Argument:**
- Nobel laureate of Chicago school
- Argued against the idea that people's belief in a diabetes cure leads to obesity as an odd or implausible reason
- Emphasized the importance of considering good reasons before invoking psychological interpretations

**Libertarian Perspective:**
- Government should keep out of individuals' ways, allowing them to make choices without interference
- Citizens are responsible for their decisions, even if they don't save enough for retirement or expose themselves to addictive substances

**Behavioral Economics:**
- Freedom comes with a cost for individuals and society when making bad choices
- Dilemma: balancing freedom and protection against mistakes

**Thaler and Sunstein's Approach:**
- Advocated libertarian paternalism: nudging people towards better decisions without curtailing their freedom
- Examples of nudges include default options that require opt-out, such as joining a pension plan.

#### Nudging Behavioral Policy for Improved Financial Planning

**Nudge Theory: Understanding Choice Architecture and Its Impact on Decisions**

**Effect of Framing (Choice Architecture)**
- Default option perceived as normal choice
- Deviating from normal requires effortful deliberation, responsibility, and potential regret

**Human vs. Econ Agents**
- Humans: need protection from exploitation, especially quirks of System 1 and System 2
- Rational agents assume careful decision making with all available information

**Implications of Rational Agent Model**
- Customers assumed to read contracts thoroughly before signing
- Disclosure size and complexity not considered relevant for Humans

**Nudge Recommendations**
- Offer simple, understandable contracts for Human customers
- Competition based on offering better products preferred over obfuscation

**Political Spectrum Appeal**
- Support from both extreme conservatives and liberals due to its appeal in behavioral policy

**Save More Tomorrow: A Financial Plan Success Story**
- Proposed by Richard Thaler and Shlomo Benartzi in 2003
- Allows employers to increase employee saving contributions automatically with pay raises
- Reduces resistance to immediate losses, turns losses into foregone gains, and aligns laziness of System 2 with long-term interests.

#### Understanding Cognitive Systems: Automatic vs Effortful Processing

**Behavioral Insight Team (BIT)**
- Created by British government to apply behavioral science principles
- Known as the "Nudge Unit"
- Thaler is an adviser
- Encourages clear, simple, salient, and meaningful disclosures
- Example: regulation on framing of fuel consumption disclosures
- Other applications: automatic enrollment in health insurance, Food Plate initiative, labeling rules for meat products

**Libertarian Paternalism**
- Philosophy that supports individual freedom while encouraging beneficial behaviors
- Recognized by governments worldwide and politicians from various parties
- Encourages use of "nudges" - non-coercive interventions to guide choices towards the best interests of the individual and society

**System 1 and System 2**
- Two fictional representations of cognitive processes in decision making
- **System 1**: automatic, unconscious processing
- **System 2**: effortful, conscious processing
- Both represent shortcuts for specific mental phenomena
- Not literal entities but helpful for understanding the workings of the mind.

#### Understanding Intuitive Thinking: The Balance Between System 1 and System 2

**System 1 and System 2**

**System 1**:
- Origin of much of what we do right
- Guides thoughts and actions routinely
- Maintains rich, detailed model of the world
    - Distinguishes surprising from normal events
    - Generates ideas of expected outcomes
    - Searches for causal interpretations of events
- Automatically acquires skills with regular practice and feedback

**System 2**:
- Articulates judgments and makes choices
- Often endorses or rationalizes ideas/feelings from System 1
- Attentive, improves performance in numerous activities
- Essential for comparison, choice, and ordered reasoning
- Not a paragon of rationality
    - Limited abilities and knowledge
    - Can make mistakes due to lack of knowledge

**System 2 vs. System 1**:
- System 1: origin of most right actions, automatic and fast
- System 2: origin of mistakes, deliberate and slower

#### Biases and Heuristics in Cognitive Processes: Overconfidence and Illusions

**Understanding Intuitive Responses: The Role of System 1**

**System 1**:
- Engaged when a specific answer is required (e.g., 17 × 24 = ?)
- Not capacity-limited, profligate in computations
- Simultaneously generates answers to related questions
- Heuristic answers may be approximately correct or wrong
- Registers cognitive ease but does not generate warning signals
- Intuitive answers come to mind quickly and confidently

**Heuristic Answers**:
- Not necessarily simpler or more frugal than original question
- Originate from skills or heuristics
- Often incorrect, despite being quick and accessible
- Biases and cognitive illusions can arise (e.g., anchoring, nonregressive predictions, overconfidence)

**Improving Judgments and Decisions**:
- Requires considerable effort to educate System 1
- Recognizing situations where errors are likely (e.g., anchoring, reframing problems)
- More progress made in recognizing others' errors than one's own

### Appendix A Judgment Under Uncertainty

**Blocking Cognitive Errors: The Role of System 1 and System 2**

**Recognizing Cognitive Minefields:**
- Slow down when in uncertain situations
- Seek reinforcement from System 2 (higher processing system)
- Identify signs of cognitive bias

**Challenges in Applying Proper Procedure:**
- Intuitions can be louder than voice of reason
- Doubt is unpleasant during stressful decision making
- More difficult to recognize cognitive illusions than perceptual ones

**Benefits of Observing Others:**
- Observers are less cognitively busy
- More open to information

**Organizational Decision Making:**
- Organizations can reduce errors by thinking more slowly
- Implement checklists, reference-class forecasting, and premortem exercises
- Encourage a culture of constructive criticism and watching out for one another

**Improving Decision Making:**
- Constant quality control instead of wholesale reviews after disasters
- Routine optimization at each stage: framing, information collection, reflection & review

**Importance of Precise Vocabulary:**
- Naming an issue provides a hook for related information and understanding
- Richer language essential for constructive criticism and diagnosis

#### Heuristics and Biases in Probability Judgments

**Assessing Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases (Tversky & Kahneman)**

**Background:**
- Many decisions based on beliefs about uncertain events
- Beliefs often expressed as probabilities or odds
- People rely on limited number of heuristics to assess probability

**The Representativeness Heuristic:**
- Determines probability that A belongs to class B
- Probabilities evaluated by degree of representation
- If A is highly representative of B: high probability
- If A not similar to B: low probability

**Types of Probabilistic Questions:**
1. What is the probability that object A belongs to class B?
2. What is the probability that event A originates from process B?
3. What is the probability that process B will generate event A?

**Assessment of Probability:**
- People often employ representativeness heuristic
- Judgment based on resemblance or representation
- Biases can lead to errors in estimation.

#### The Representation Heuristic and Ignoring Base Rates

**Representativeness Heuristic**

**Shy and Withdrawn Individual (Steve)**
- Described as: shy, withdrawn, helpful, little interest in people or reality, meek, tidy soul, need for order and structure, passionate about detail

**Judgment of Probability by Representativeness**
- Assessing probability that Steve is engaged in a particular occupation based on his resemblance to stereotype
- Research shows people assess probability and order occupations by similarity using representativeness heuristic

**Errors in Judging Probability**
- Neglects prior probability, or base rate frequency, of outcomes
  - Factors that should affect judgments of probability
  - In case of Steve: number of farmers vs librarians in population
  - Prior probabilities do not affect representativeness

**Experimental Evidence**
- Study where subjects assessed probability of personality description belonging to engineer or lawyer
  - Subjects shown brief personality descriptions of individuals from group of 70 engineers and 30 lawyers vs. 30 engineers and 70 lawyers
  - Odds of description belonging to engineer should be higher in condition with majority of engineers (70%) compared to condition with majority of lawyers (30%)
- Subjects produced essentially the same probability judgments despite different base rates, violating Bayes' rule
- Implies subjects evaluated likelihood of description belonging to engineer vs. lawyer by representativeness heuristic without regard for prior probabilities.

#### Overestimation of Representativeness and Ignorance of Sample Size in Probability Judgment

**Factors Affecting Probability Assessments:**

**Prior Probabilities**:
- Prior probabilities were ignored when an uninformative description was given
- Intended to convey no information relevant to the question of whether Dick is an engineer or a lawyer
- Subjects assigned equal probability of Dick being an engineer regardless of group composition (.7 or .3)

**Representativeness Heuristic**:
- People typically evaluate probabilities by assessing the similarity between sample results and population parameters
- Similarity does not depend on sample size
- When asked about average height in samples of various sizes, subjects produced identical distributions
- Failed to appreciate the role of sample size even when emphasized

**Example Question**:
- A hospital recorded the days on which more than 60% of babies were boys
- Most subjects judged probability of this event being true for both small and large hospitals
- Sampling theory entails that expected number of such days is much greater in smaller hospital due to less likely deviation from population mean.

#### Misconceptions about Chance and Statistical Reasoning

**Misconceptions of Statistics and Chance**

**Insensitivity to Sample Size**:
- People struggle to understand the significance of sample size in determining posterior probability
- Individuals may feel more confident in a smaller sample with a larger proportion of desired outcome, rather than a larger sample with a smaller proportion

**Conservatism and Local Representativeness**:
- People expect random processes to exhibit representative patterns even in small samples
- This leads to misconceptions about the behavior of chance events, such as:
  - Belief that long runs of a particular outcome will be "corrected" by an opposite outcome
  - Overestimation of the replicability of statistically significant results in small samples

**Misconceptions Among Researchers**:
- Experienced researchers can also fall prey to misconceptions about chance and statistics
- This can lead to selection of inadequate sample sizes and overinterpretation of findings

#### Illusion of Validity in Predictive Judgments

**Insensitivity to Predictability**
- People often make numerical predictions based on representativeness instead of considering predictability
- Example: Predicting future profit of a company based on description without regard for reliability or accuracy of evidence
- If predictions are solely based on favorableness of description, they will be insensitive to:
  - Reliability of evidence
  - Expected accuracy of prediction
- This violates the normative statistical theory where extremeness and range of predictions are controlled by considerations of predictability

**Predictive Inaccuracy and Illusions of Validity**
- Studies show intuitive predictions violate the rule of widening range of predicted values with increasing predictability
- Subjects make identical evaluations and predictions (e.g., student teacher performance vs future success) despite limited predictability
- Confidence in predictions depends primarily on representativeness, not considerations of predictive accuracy or limitations.

#### Regression Towards the Mean: A Cognitive Bias Explanation

**The Illusion of Validity and Regression Toward the Mean**

**The Illusion of Validity**:
- People have high confidence in predictions when:
    - Personality description matches stereotype
    - Description is scanty, unreliable, or outdated
- This "illusion of validity" persists even when judge knows of factors limiting accuracy

**Clinical Interviews and Selection**:
- Psychologists often have high confidence in predictions from clinical interviews
- Despite known fallibility of selection interviews
- Continued reliance on clinical interviews attests to strength of this effect

**Internal Consistency and Confidence**:
- Highly consistent patterns increase confidence in predictions
- Redundancy among inputs can decrease accuracy, despite increasing confidence
- People often confident in predictions likely to be off the mark

**Misconceptions of Regression**:
- If two variables have same distribution:
    - Selecting high scorers on one will usually perform worse on other
    - Selecting low scorers on one will perform better on other
- Regression toward the mean:
    - Average score of individuals deviating from mean will regress toward mean
    - First documented by Galton over 100 years ago
- Observed in comparisons of height, intelligence, and performance on consecutive exams.

#### The Peculiar Effects of Regression and Availability in Learning and Decision Making

**Regression Phenomenon:**
- People often fail to predict or recognize regression in many contexts where it occurs
- When recognized, causal explanations may be spurious
- Regression is incompatible with belief that outcome should maximally represent input
- Consequences of not recognizing regression can be pernicious

**Flight Training:**
- Instructors noted praise for smooth landing leads to poorer next try (regression)
- Harsh criticism after rough landing leads to improvement (regression)
- Misconclusion: punishments are more effective than rewards

**Social Interaction and Rewards:**
- Rewards given after good performance, punishments after poor ones
- Regression causes behavior to improve after punishment and deteriorate after reward
- Human condition leads to most rewards for punishing others, most punishments for rewarding them (people are often unaware)

**Availability Heuristic:**
- People assess frequency or probability by ease of bringing instances to mind
- Availability is affected by factors other than frequency and probability
- Reliance on availability leads to predictable biases

**Biases due to Retrievability of Instances:**
- Classes with easily retrieved instances appear more numerous than equal frequency classes with less retrievable instances.

#### Biases in Estimating Frequency Based on Search Set and Imaginability

**Factors Affecting Retrievability of Instances:**
- **Familiarity**: Subjects mistakenly assume more famous personalities belong to dominant class (men or women) based on lists with disproportionate fame levels.
- **Salience**: Impact of recent occurrences and attention-grabbing events increases their subjective probability.
- **Recency**: Recent instances are more available for judgment compared to older ones.

**Biases due to Effectiveness of Search Sets:**
- People assess frequency by recalling words starting with specific letters or having certain positions based on ease of retrieval. For instance:
  * Word starting with 'r': road
  * Word containing 'r' as third letter: car
- Abstract words are judged more numerous than concrete ones due to easier context generation for abstract concepts.

**Biases in Imaginability:**
- Assessing frequency of a class without memory storage involves generating instances and evaluating them based on ease of construction, which may not reflect their actual frequency or probability. This mode of evaluation is prone to biases.

#### Illusory Correlation and Judgment of Probabilities

**Forming Committees: Binomial Coefficient**
* Group of 10 people forms committees of size k (k = 2,3,...,8)
* Number of different committees = binomial coefficient (10/k)
* Reaches a maximum for k = 5 (252)
* One committee equals the number of non-members in another committee
* Easier to construct smaller committees
* Partition of group into disjoint sets
* Imaginability plays a role in evaluating probabilities
* Fewer members: more available, easier to construct
* Large committees: difficult to construct
* Naive estimates of number of distinct committees decreasing monotonic function of committee size
* Median estimate for 2 members = 70, for 8 members = 20 (incorrect)

**Illusory Correlation**: Chapman and Chapman Study
* Describing bias in judgment of frequency two events co-occur
* Naive judges estimated illusory correlation between clinical diagnosis and drawing features
* Overestimated frequent occurrence of natural associates
* Erroneous judgments rediscovered common but unfounded clinical lore.

#### Illusory Correlation and Anchoring Biases in Estimation

**The Illusory Correlation Effect:**
* Resistant to contradictory data
* Persists even when correlation between symptom and diagnosis is negative
* Prevents judges from detecting relationships that are present

**Causes of the Illusory Correlation Effect:**
* Based on strength of associative bond between events
* Stronger associations lead to belief of frequent co-occurrence
* Example: suspiciousness and peculiar drawing of eyes
* Lifelong experience strengthens associative connections when events frequently co-occur
* Results in systematic errors despite being a valuable estimation procedure

**Adjustment and Anchoring:**
* People make estimates by starting from an initial value (anchoring point) and adjusting to the final answer
* Initial values can be suggested by problem formulation or partial computation
* Adjustments are typically insufficient, resulting in biased estimates towards the anchoring point.
* Demonstration: subjects estimated percentage of African countries in UN based on a random number given as starting point. Arbitrary numbers significantly affected estimates.
* Payoffs for accuracy did not reduce anchoring effect.

**Additional Notes:**
* Anchoring occurs when subject's estimate is based on an initial value or result of incomplete computation.

#### Biases in Estimating Conjunctive and Disjunctive Events

**Numerical Estimation Study:**
* Two groups of high school students estimated numerical expressions on blackboard:
  * Group 1: 8 ×7 ×6 ×5 ×4 ×3 ×2 ×1
  * Group 2: 1 ×2 ×3 ×4 ×5 ×6 ×7 ×8
* People perform initial computations and estimate products through extrapolation or adjustment
* Descending sequence (Group 1) should lead to larger estimates due to higher intermediate results
* Confirmed: Median estimate for ascending sequence was 512, descending sequence was 2,250
* Correct answer is 40,320

**Biases in Evaluation of Conjunctive and Disjunctive Events:**
* Study by Bar-Hillel investigated betting preferences on various events:
  * Simple events (50% chance)
  * Conjunctive events (lower probability than simple but higher than chance)
  * Disjunctive events (higher probability than simple but lower than chance)
* Significant majority of subjects preferred to bet on conjunctive event with a probability of .48 over simple event at .50, and simple event over disjunctive at .52
* Illustrates that people tend to overestimate the probability of conjunctive events and underestimate disjunctive events
* Biases are caused by anchoring effect:
  * Starting point for estimation provided by stated probability of elementary event
  * Insufficient adjustments from starting point lead to final estimates being too close to probabilities of elementary events
* Overall probability of conjunctive events is lower than probability of each elementary event, while disjunctive events' overall probability is higher.

#### Anchoring Bias in Subjective Probability Judgments

**Biases in Evaluating Compound Events:**
* **Conjunctive events**: successful completion of an undertaking requires multiple events to occur sequentially
	+ Each event may be likely but overall probability of success can be low due to large number of events
	+ Leads to unwarranted optimism about plan success or project completion on time
* **Disjunctive events**: complex systems malfunction if any essential component fails
	+ High probability of overall failure even with slight likelihood of failure in each component
	+ People tend to underestimate probabilities of failure in complex systems
	+ Direction of anchoring bias depends on structure: overestimation for conjunctions, underestimation for disjunctions.

**Assessing Subjective Probability Distributions:**
* In decision analysis, experts required to express beliefs as probability distributions
* Constructed by asking for values corresponding to specified percentiles of the distribution
* For example, select X% such that there is a 90% chance it will not exceed the value of Dow Jones average
* Proper calibration: exactly % of true values fall below X% and % above X% in 98% of problems.
* Departures from proper calibration found in distributions obtained from multiple judges.

#### Anchoring Bias in Subjective Probability Estimation

**Effects of Assessing Confidence Intervals:**
- **30% of assessed quantities**: actual values lie outside the range X 0l - X 99 for many studies
- Subjects exhibit overly narrow confidence intervals, demonstrating greater certainty than justified
- Effect is common to both naive and sophisticated subjects
- Not eliminated by proper scoring rules
- Anchoring effect plays a role:
  * Natural to begin with best estimate and adjust upwards or downwards
  * Insufficient adjustments result in too narrow confidence intervals

**Procedure for Obtaining Subjective Probability Distributions:**
- Two methods:
  1. Selecting values that correspond to specified percentiles of probability distribution
  2. Assessing probabilities that true value will exceed specified values
- Formally equivalent but suggest different modes of adjustment
- In procedure (i), best estimate serves as anchor
- In procedure (ii), value stated in question or even odds may be anchors
- Procedure (ii) yields less extreme odds due to different anchoring effects

**Experiment with Two Groups:**
- Group 1: Assessed X 10 and X 90 for each problem
- Group 2: Retrieved medians of Group 1's judgments, then assessed odds that given values exceed true value
- Without bias, second group should retrieve identical distributions as first group (9:1 odds)
- Anchoring effect observed in Group 2: median odds closer to 1:1 instead of 9:1.
- Subjects in first group showed too extreme judgments, consistent with earlier studies.

#### Cognitive Biases and Judgmental Heuristics: Impact on Subjective Probability

**Cognitive Biases from Heuristics:**
* **Calibration of Probability**: events with assigned low probability actually occur more frequently than expected (24%)
* **Conservatism bias**: subjects tend to overestimate likelihood of certain events (34% obtain vs. 26%)
* The degree of calibration depends on procedure of elicitation
* Heuristics like representativeness and availability are prevalent despite occasional biases
* Experienced researchers also prone to similar intuitive judgments errors
* Lack of understanding fundamental statistical rules: regression toward the mean, effect of sample size on variability
* People do not learn these principles from everyday experience due to lack of appropriate coding
* Difficulty in detecting biases in judgments of probability
	+ Individuals cannot easily group events by judged probability
	+ Implications for theoretical and applied roles of subjective probabilities

**Subjective Probability:**
* Modern decision theory defines it as quantified opinion of an idealized person
* Coherent subjective probabilities derived from choices among bets that satisfy axioms
* In reality, subjective probabilities determine preferences among bets and are not derived from them
* Critique: internally consistent probability judgments may be incompatible with other beliefs held by the individual.

#### Understanding Heuristics in Uncertainty Judgments: Bias and Errors Explained

**Understanding Judgments Under Uncertainty: Three Heuristics and Their Biases**

**Three Heuristics for Making Judgments Under Uncertainty:**
- **Representativeness**: used to judge the probability that an object or event belongs to a class or process.
- **Availability of Instances or Scenarios**: assessed when judging the frequency of a class or plausibility of development.
- **Adjustment from an Anchor**: employed in numerical prediction when a relevant value is available.

**Characteristics and Limitations:**
- These heuristics are economical and effective, but lead to systematic errors.
- A better understanding of these heuristics can improve judgments and decisions under uncertainty.

**Representativeness Heuristic**:
- Described by Kahneman & Tversky (1973) in "On the Psychology of Prediction"
- Used when judging probability that an object or event belongs to a class or process.

**Availability Heuristic**:
- Described by Kahneman & Tversky (1972) in "Subjective Probability: A Judgment of Representativeness"
- Used when assessing frequency of a class or plausibility of development.

**Adjustment from Anchor Heuristic**:
- Described by Edwards (1968) in "Conservatism in Human Information Processing"
- Used in numerical prediction with relevant values available.

**Implications:**
- These heuristics can lead to systematic biases and errors.
- Understanding these heuristics is crucial for improving judgments and decisions under uncertainty.

### Appendix B Choices Values and Frames

**Risky vs. Riskless Choices**

**Risky Choices**:
- Made without advance knowledge of consequences
- Consequences depend on uncertain events (e.g., weather, opponent's resolve)
- Can be construed as accepting a gamble with various outcomes and probabilities
- Study focuses on choices between simple gambles and monetary outcomes

**Psychophysical Approach to Decision Making**:
- Traced back to an essay by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738 (Bernoulli, 1954)
- Explains why people are generally averse to risk and how it decreases with increasing wealth
- **Example**: Choosing between:
    - An 85% chance of winning $1,000 (with a 15% chance of winning nothing)
    - Receiving $800 for sure
- A large majority of people prefer the **sure thing** over the gamble, even though the gamble has a higher **mathematical expectation** ($850 vs. $800)

**Descriptive vs. Normative Analysis**:
- Normative analysis: Concerned with the nature of rationality and logic of decision making
- Descriptive analysis: Concerned with people's beliefs and preferences as they are, not as they should be

#### Risk Aversion and Subjective Value: An Overview of Prospect Theory

**Risk Aversion and Utility Function**

**Definition of Risk Aversion:**
- Preference for a sure outcome over a gamble with higher or equal expectation is called risk averse
- Rejection of a sure thing in favor of a lower or equal expectation gamble is called risk seeking

**Bernoulli's Perspective:**
- People evaluate prospects not by monetary outcomes, but subjective value
- Subjective value of a gamble: weighted average of subjective values and probabilities

**Utility Function:**
- Concave function of money for gains (subjective value increases more than linearly)
- Convex function of money for losses (subjective value decreases less than linearly)

**Prospect Theory:**
- Outcomes represented as changes in wealth instead of total wealth
- Introspection suggests subjective value is concave for gains and losses
- Value function defined on gains and losses, concave in gain domain, convex in loss domain, steeper for losses (loss aversion)

**Implications:**
- People are reluctant to bet on fair coins due to potential losses being more aversive than potential gains being attractive.

#### Risk-Taking Behavior: Axioms of Rational Choice and Inconsistency

**Risk Aversion and Risk Seeking**

**Assumption of Risk Aversion**:
- Central role in economic theory
- Concavity of value of gains entails risk aversion
- Convexity of value of losses entails risk seeking

**Risk Seeking in Losses**:
- Robust effect, particularly when probabilities of loss are substantial
- Example: Preference for 85% chance to lose $1,000 (with 15% chance to lose nothing) over sure loss of $800
- Confirmed by several investigators with nonmonetary outcomes

**Normative Issue**:
- Is it wrong to be risk averse in gains and risk seeking in losses?
- Addressed through decision theory

**Decision Theory Principles**:
- **Dominance**: If A is better than B in at least one respect, A should be preferred to B
- **Invariance**: Preference order between prospects should not depend on how they are described

**Violation of Invariance**:
- Cannot generally be satisfied due to the way choices are framed

#### Framing Effects in Risky Choice Problems

**Framing of Outcomes**

**Risky Prospects**:
- Characterized by possible outcomes and probabilities of these outcomes
- Can be framed or described differently

**Changes in Description of Outcomes**:
- Should not alter preference order (invariance)
- Example: Gains/losses vs. asset positions

**Problem 1**:
- 600 people will die, two programs to save lives
- 72% prefer Program A (save 200) over B (gamble on saving up to 600)

**Problem 2**:
- Same cover story, but different description of prospects
- 22% prefer Program C (400 will die) over D (gamble on nobody to 600 dying)

**Invariance Failure**:
- Options C/D and A/B are real terms
- Preferences differ due to reference state
- Common among sophisticated and naive respondents
- Not eliminated even when respondents answer both questions

#### Framing Effects and Decision Inconsistencies: A Case Study

**Framing Effects and Rational Choice**

**Problem Analysis**:
- Even after rereading, people still prefer:
  - Risk aversion in "lives saved" version
  - Risk seeking in "lives lost" version
  - Invariance and consistent answers between versions
- Framing effects resemble perceptual illusions more than computational errors

**Dominance Requirement Violation**:
- Problem 3: Elicits preferences that violate dominance requirement
  - Example problem with stake differences
  - Majority chose F (risk seeking) over E (risk averse)

**Concurrent Decisions**:
- Problem 4: Majority made risk averse choice for sure gain over positive gamble
  - Large majority made risk seeking choice for gamble over sure loss
- Preferred conjunction dominated by rejected one
- Violation of invariance and dominance

**Implications**:
- Invariance is normatively essential, intuitively compelling, and psychologically unfeasible
- Two ways to ensure invariance:
  - Adopt a procedure to transform equivalent problems into the same representation (e.g., total assets)
  - Advice easier to give than follow

#### Non-linear Utility and Probability Weighting in Decision Making

**Financial Outcomes: Gains and Losses vs. Wealth States**
- People naturally consider financial outcomes as gains and losses rather than states of wealth
- Representing risky prospects requires compounding all outcomes of concurrent decisions, exceeding intuitive computational capabilities
- Achieving a canonical representation is more difficult in contexts like safety, health, or quality of life

**Framing Decisions: Mortality vs. Actuarial Criterion**
- Choices are not frame invariant: same choice may not be made in different frames
- Advise people to evaluate public health policies based on overall mortality, disease mortality, or number of deaths related to the particular disease under study
- Actuarial criterion is inadequate for financial choices and irrelevant for outcomes without objective metrics

**Psychophysics of Chances: Expectation Rule vs. Intuitive Valuations**
- Assuming status quo is zero, the value of a $300 cash gift is one when certain
- Probability of winning a single prize lottery with a probability p:
  - Value varies between 0 (no chance) and 1 (certainty)
  - Intuition suggests nonlinear relationship between probability and value
    - Increase from 0% to 5% has larger effect than 30% to 35%
    - Change from impossibility to possibility or certainty has bigger impact than comparable changes in the middle
- Decision weights are regressive with respect to stated probabilities (Figure 2)

#### Risk Perception and Decision Weighting: Effects on Preferences for Gains and Losses

**Implications of Psychophysical Hypotheses for Preferences Among Risky Options**

**Decision Weights vs. Probabilities**:
- Decision weights are lower than probabilities over most of the range
- Underweighting of moderate/high probabilities contributes to risk aversion in gains and risk seeking in losses
- Low probabilities are overweighted, leading to attraction to long shots and amplification of aversiveness for small chances of severe loss

**Nonlinearity of Decision Weights**:
- Inevitably leads to violations of invariance
- Illustrated by Problems 5 and 6:
  - Problem 5: A clear majority favors higher chance to win smaller amount
  - Problem 6: Majority goes the other way
- Attributed to framing of probabilities and nonlinearity of decision weights

**Problem Framing**:
- In Problem 5, people ignore first phase and focus on second stage outcomes

#### Pseudo-Certainty Effect in Probabilistic Decision Making

**Pseudo-Certainty Effect and Probabilistic Insurance**

**Understanding the Pseudo-Certainty Effect:**
- People's choices in sequential versions are almost identical to choices between a sure gain and an 85% chance
- Overweighting of certain events as compared to moderate or high probability ones (Miller & Phelps, 1979)

**Probabilistic Insurance:**
- Reduction in the decision weight for low probabilities compared to reduction from p/2 to 0 is significant
- Aversion to probabilistic insurance:
  1. Undermines classical explanation of insurance through concave utility function
  2. Represents forms of protective action like checkups or burglar alarms that reduce hazard probability but don't eliminate it
  3. Acceptability can be manipulated by framing contingencies (Slovic, Fischhoff, & Lichtenstein, 1982)

**Figure 2:**
- Reducing risk by half not worth half the premium in region of low probabilities
- People greatly undervalue reduction in probability of hazard compared to complete elimination.

#### Framing Effects in Decision Making: Nonlinearity and Manipulation

**Formulation Effects**

**Framing Effects**:
- Demonstrated by a change of wording from "lives saved" to "lives lost", inducing a shift from risk aversion to risk seeking
- Subjects adopted the provided descriptions as given and evaluated the outcomes accordingly

**Formulation Effect in Healthcare**:
- Preferences of physicians and patients between hypothetical therapies for lung cancer varied when outcomes were described in terms of mortality or survival
- Surgery less attractive when described in terms of mortality rather than survival, as it entails a risk of death during treatment

**Formulation Effects in Decision Making**:
- Can occur fortuitously, without awareness
- Can be exploited deliberately to manipulate the relative attractiveness of options
- Evaluation of outcomes susceptible to formulation effects due to nonlinearity of value function and tendency to evaluate options based on suggested reference point

**Recoding of Information**:
- People automatically transform equivalent messages into a common abstract representation
- However, mental machinery for this process is not adequate to recode the public health problem or mortality/survival statistics into a common form

#### Evaluating Transactions: Mental Accounting in Decision Making

**Mental Accounting and Multiattribute Options**

**Framing and Value**:
- Evaluating multiattribute options involves setting up a mental account that specifies:
    - Advantages associated with the option
    - Disadvantages associated with the option
    - Relative to a multiattribute reference state
- The overall value of an option is the balance of its advantages and disadvantages relative to the reference state
- An option is acceptable if the value of its advantages exceeds the value of its disadvantages
- This analysis assumes **psychological**, not physical, separability of advantages and disadvantages

**Mental Accounting Model**:
- Does not constrain how separate attributes are combined to form overall measures of advantage and disadvantage
- Imposes assumptions of **concavity** and **loss aversion** on these measures

**Thaler's Work**:
- Relevance of mental accounting process to consumer behavior (Thaler, 1980, 1985)

**Mental Accounting Problem**:
- Imagining purchasing a jacket for $125 and a calculator for $15
- Salesman informs that the calculator is on sale for $10 at another store
- Question: Would you make a trip to the other store?

**Account Types**:
- **Minimal Account**: Includes only differences between options, disregarding shared features
    - Advantage framed as a gain of $5
- **Topical Account**: Relates consequences of choices to a reference level determined by the decision context
    - Relevant topic is calculator purchase, so benefit framed as reduction in price from $15 to $10
    - Jacket price and other expenses not included
- **Comprehensive Account**: Evaluating saving in relation to monthly expenses

**Default Framing**:
- People may spontaneously frame decisions in terms of topical accounts, analogous to "good forms" in perception and "basic-level categories" in cognition.

#### Mental Accounting and Topical Organization in Consumer Behavior

**Topical Organization of Mental Accounts**

**Concept**: Topical organization entails that people evaluate gains and losses relative to a specific context or account. This affects consumer behavior by influencing the effort exerted to save money, as shown in the following examples:

**Example 1**: Prices of calculator and jacket are interchanged:
- Price of calculator: $125 vs $120
- Price of jacket: $15
- Proportion willing to make trip for savings on calculator: 29% (N = 93) vs 68% (N = 88) on calculator ($15)
- Results indicate topical organization in consumer decision making, as the responses are inversely related to price and independent of each other.

**Implications**: Dispersion of prices is roughly proportional to average product price; consumers make more effort to save $15 on a $150 purchase than on a $50 purchase.

**Example 2**: Problem with lost theater tickets:
- Problem 1: Lost ticket for play with admission price $10, would you pay $10 for another? (Yes: 46%, No: 54%)
- Problem 2: Lost a $10 bill during entry to the play with admission price $10, would you still pay $10 for a ticket? (Yes: 88%, No: 12%)
- Difference between responses highlights the impact of topical organization on consumer behavior and mental accounting.

#### Mental Accounting and Decision Making: Loss Aversion and Framing Effects

**Mental Accounting Effects**

**Difference in Behavior between Lost Ticket and Cash**:
- People are willing to spend $10 to replace a lost ticket, but not to buy an additional ticket for the same play
- This is due to the topical organization of mental accounts
- Going to the theater is viewed as a transaction where ticket cost is exchanged for the experience of seeing the play
- Buying a second ticket increases the cost of seeing the play, making it unacceptable to many
- Loss of cash does not affect the purchase of a ticket, only makes the individual feel less affluent

**Effect of Problem Order**:
- Subjects were more willing to replace a lost ticket when presented with the lost-cash problem first
- Conversely, the willingness to buy a ticket after losing cash was not affected by prior presentation of the other problem
- This suggests that subjects realized it makes sense to think of the lost ticket as lost cash, but not vice versa

**Normative Status**:
- The effects of mental accounting are questionable
- Earlier examples differed only in form, while these problems differ in substance
- Secondary consequences, such as pleasure from saving or annoyance from paying twice, can affect preferences
- These secondary consequences may change upon reflection

**Losses and Costs**:
- Many decision problems involve a choice between retaining the status quo and an alternative
- The status quo defines the reference level for all attributes
- Advantages of alternatives are evaluated as gains, while disadvantages are losses
- This leads to a bias in favor of retaining the status quo

#### Endowment Effect: Loss Aversion in Economic Decisions

**Endowment Effect**

**Thaler's Findings**:
- People are reluctant to part from their assets (endowment)
- Buying prices are lower than selling prices
- Substantial discrepancies between hypothetical and real buying/selling transactions reported in studies

**Behavioral Economics Experiments**:
- Study on choosing jobs:
  - Subjects assigned to position A were reluctant to move to B, even if B was better in some respects
  - Subjects assigned to B did not want to move to A
- Loss aversion favors stability over change

**Implications**:
- Endowment effect unlikely to play a significant role in routine economic exchanges
- Merchants evaluate money as revenue, not loss
- Payments made by consumers are not evaluated as losses but alternative purchases

#### Framing Negative Outcomes as Costs Improves Subjective State

**Evaluating Value: Cost vs. Loss**

**Cost-Loss Discrepancy**:
- When evaluating a choice between a cost and a loss:
  - If the **subjective value of the alternative exceeds the cost**, it will be chosen
  - **Disadvantages can be framed as either costs or losses**
    - Purchase of insurance: framed as choice between sure loss vs. risk of greater loss
    - Cost-loss discrepancy can lead to failures of invariance

**Example: Gamble vs. Lottery**:
- **Problem 10**: Accept a gamble with 10% chance to win $95, 90% chance to lose $5? (132 respondents)
    - 42 rejected the gamble but accepted the equivalent lottery in Problem 11
- **Problem 11**: Pay $5 for a lottery with 10% chance to win $100, 90% chance to win nothing? (132 respondents)
    - Similar options, yet preferences were reversed in the two problems
    - Thinking of $5 as a payment makes it more acceptable than thinking of it as a loss

**Implications**:
- Subjective state can be improved by framing negative outcomes as costs rather than losses
- **Dead-Loss Effect**: Playing in pain may be more preferable than recognizing the cost as a dead loss

#### Hedonic Adaptation and Decision Making: Mismatch Between Values

**Concluding Remarks**
- **Distinction between Experience Value and Decision Value**:
    - **Experience Value**: Degree of pleasure or pain, satisfaction or anguish in the actual experience of an outcome
    - **Decision Value**: Contribution of an anticipated outcome to the overall attractiveness or aversiveness of an option in a choice
- **Assumption of Correspondence**:
    - Commonly assumed that decision values and experience values coincide
    - Part of the conception of an idealized decision maker
- **Ordinary Decision Makers vs. Idealized Decision Maker**:
    - For ordinary decision makers, correspondence between decision values and experience values is far from perfect
    - Some factors that affect experience are not easily anticipated
    - Some factors that affect decisions do not have a comparable impact on the experience of outcomes
- **Hedonic Psychophysics**: Relates hedonic (pleasurable/painful) experience to objective states
    - Determination of the level of adaptation or aspiration that separates positive from negative outcomes
    - Hedonic reference point is determined by the objective status quo, expectations, and social comparisons
- **Hedonic Adaptation and the "Hedonic Treadmill"**:
    - Rapid adaptation can cause the effects of an objective improvement to be short-lived
    - Experiences of pleasure/pain are critically dependent on the dynamics of hedonic adaptation
- **Difficulty in Anticipating Experience**:
    - The common mismatch between decision values and experience values introduces uncertainty in decision problems
    - Prevalence of framing effects and violations of variance further complicates the relationship between decision values and experience values
- **Framing of Outcomes**:
    - Framing can induce decision values with no counterpart in actual experience
    - Framing can also affect the experience itself (e.g., framing as uncompensated loss vs. insurance)

* Evie Vergauwe et al. (2010): "Do Mental Processes Share a Domain-General Resource?" (Psychological Science)

**Findings:**
- Growing evidence for general-purpose resources of attention
- Anticipation of high-effort tasks mobilizes activity in many brain areas
- Pupil size correlates with cognitive workload

**Terminology and Context:**
* Subject vs. participant: "Subject" can imply subjugation, APA prefers "participant" but it's a mouthful (switch to subject when necessary)
* Heart rate increases during mental tasks
* Rapidly flashing letters impair perception
* Multitasking difficulties: physical limitations and competition for separate mechanisms
* Improvement with practice but general resource of attention or effort necessary in many tasks

#### The Lazy Brain and Decision Making

**Intelligence and Attention**

**SAT Scores and Pupillary Dilation**:
- Individuals with higher SAT scores showed smaller pupillary dilations than low scorers during the same task
- Indicates less mental effort required for higher intelligence individuals

**Law of Least Effort**:
- Decision making and avoidance of cognitive demand is influenced by the "law of least effort"
- People tend to take the easiest route to solve problems

**Neural Computation of Action Value**:
- Neuroscientists have identified a brain region that assesses the overall value of an action upon completion
- Effort invested counts as a cost in this neural computation

**Reading Distracting Words**:
- Pupillary Stroop effects show increased mental effort when reading distracting words

**Association with Intelligence**:
- Tests of general intelligence are correlated with working memory capacity and attention networks

**Time Pressure and Attention**:
- Working under time pressure increases cognitive demands and attentional resource usage

**Tests of General Intelligence**:
- Tests of general intelligence, such as the SAT, measure a combination of attention, working memory, and processing speed

**Attention in the Israeli Air Force**:
- Israeli Air Force pilots' selective attention performance correlated with flight training success
- Attention measures can predict real-world outcomes

#### Understanding Cognitive Fluency and Its Effects on Perception

**Cognitive Ease and Fluency**

**Terminology:**
- Cognitive ease is also known as **fluency**
- Diverse inputs and outputs

**Familiarity and Recognition:**
- The sense of familiarity protects us from embarrassment when meeting someone we recognize only vaguely
- Specific memories are not always available, so the feeling of familiarity serves as a fallback
- This fallback is more reliable than nothing

**Factors Affecting Familiarity and Cognitive Ease:**
- **Body temperature of a chicken**: Difficulty recalling specific details when remembering someone
- **Low credibility**: Unfamiliar words or information are less believable
- When words rhyme: Rhyme facilitates recognition and cognitive ease
- Fictitious Turkish companies: Easier to remember if the names are fluently processed

**Engaging Analytic Mode:**
- Difficulty in analytical thinking can be activated by metacognitive challenges
- Facilitated processing leads to increased positive affect and engagement in analytic mode

**Visual Processing:**
- Easier processing of pictures of objects enhances cognitive ease and positive emotion

**Marketing Implications:**
- Small advantages, such as product names or company brands, can have a significant impact on consumer perception due to fluency effects.

#### Anchors, Associative Coherence, and the Law of Small Numbers in Psychology

**Telephone Survey Findings:**
* Version 1: Weather affected reported happiness
* Version 2: No effect of weather on reported happiness
* Explanation: In version 2, respondents were primed with the current weather before being asked about happiness, which influenced their response by providing an explanation for their mood and weakened the connection between current mood and overall happiness.

	+ Weighted more: Importance given to personal experiences over statistics
	+ Opposite effect: Misinterpreting rarity of events
- **Bayes's rule**: Posterior odds = prior odds × likelihood ratio
	+ Diagnosis example: Friend tests positive for a rare disease, odds rise from 1/600 to 25/600 (11%)
- **Linda example**: Role of heuristics in reasoning
	+ Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: Conjunction fallacy and its implications

- **Regression to the Mean**
    - Michael Bulmer's Francis Galton's work on heredity and biometry
    - Standard scores in statistics
        * Subtract mean, divide by standard deviation
        * Mean = 0; standard deviation = 1
        * Compare across variables with similar distributions
    - Correlation between parent and child height/weight: not true when nutrition is a factor
- **Correlation vs. Causation**
    - Height and weight correlation: large sample from Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index

- Nicholas Bernoulli: St. Petersburg paradox, a question regarding tossing a coin repeatedly in a game.

#### Prospect Theory & Behavioral Finance

**Bernoulli's Theory of Gambling**

**Expected Value vs. Utility**:
- The expected value of a gamble is infinite due to the potential for exponential growth from multiple heads in a coin toss game
- However, the utility of prizes grows much more slowly, making the gamble unattractive
- People are willing to pay only a few dollars for an opportunity to play the game

**Factors Favoring Bernoulli's Theory**:
- Natural to formulate choices in terms of gains or mixed gains and losses
- Ignoring past wealth is often a reasonable approach
- Economists were traditionally concerned with rational choices, and Bernoulli's model fit their goals

**Prospect Theory**:
- Formulation of choices based on final states of wealth rather than past history
- Stylized rendition of the value function graph used as an emblem for Nobel laureates

**Loss Aversion**:
- Loss aversion ratio is often around 1.5 to 2.5
- Emotional reaction to losses can lead individuals to make certain choices
- Rabin's theorem challenges Bernoulli's theory by showing that the rejection of a gamble implies a significant decrease in the value of $1

**Rejecting the Gamble**:
- Rejecting a gamble with equal probabilities to win $11 or lose $10 implies an extraordinarily steep decline in the value of $1 for the individual
- The effect of this decrease increases as the gambles become more extreme

**Conclusion**:
- Even a lousy lawyer can provide a compelling mathematical argument that challenges Bernoulli's theory, which economists are particularly sensitive to.

#### Loss Aversion and Decision Making in Economics and Psychology

    - Actual losses and foregone gains have asymmetrical effects on individual well-being

#### Paradoxes in Decision Making: Rationality vs Psychology

**Allais Paradox and Rational Decision Making:**

**Background**
- Described by economist Kenneth Arrow as an unnoticed experiment during a meeting (March 16, 2011)
- Participants paid little attention to the implications for decision making

**Two Problems**
1. Preferred left-hand option in first problem: simpler violation of rationality
   - Adding more valuable prospect to left than right
   - Right-hand option preferred despite being less beneficial
2. Second problem: estimates for gains and losses (see table)
   - Similar decision weights estimated from choices
   - Violations observed in preferences for risk reduction

**Observed Preferences vs. Rational Model**
- People should pay more to reduce accidents' frequency than eliminate risk (two-thirds rule)
- Observed preferences violated this prediction

**Decision Analysis and Law**
- Chris Guthrie's research on prospect theory, risk preference, and law
  - Prospect Theory: emotions, worst cases, and litigation
  - Frivolous litigation theory (2000)

**Impact of Feelings in Decision Making:**
1. Wish to avoid rare events (Loewenstein et al., 2001)
2. Vividness in decision making: emotions influence judgments (Sunstein, 2002)
3. Focal event and its complement: probabilities do not always add up to 100%
4. Judgments of probabilities may be influenced by emotions or lack of knowledge.

#### Understanding Decision Making Biases in Risk and Investment

**Cumulative Prospect Theory**
- Decision weights for gains and losses are not assumed to be equal in cumulative prospect theory

**Superficial Processing**
- The question about the two urns was invented by Dale T. Miller, William Turnbull, and Cathy McFarland
- Seymour Epstein and colleagues argued for an interpretation in terms of two systems: cognitive and experiential

**Judging Dangerous Scenarios**
- Kimihiko Yamagishi studied the distinction between objective and subjective probability in risk communication
- People may perceive a higher risk in low-probability, high-consequence events (e.g., 12.86% mortality vs. 24.14%)

**Forensic Psychology and Risk Assessment**
- Slovic, Monahan, and MacGregor discussed the role of mental simulation in risk assessment and communication
- Jonathan Koehler examined how people are persuaded by DNA match statistics in capital cases

**Decisions from Experience vs. Description**
- Ralph Hertwig and colleagues studied the difference between decisions based on experience versus description
- Rare events can significantly impact decision making, leading to a "description-experience gap"
- The choice between two options may be influenced by whether the person has experienced the consequences before

**The Anchoring Effect and Sunk Costs**
- Thomas Langer and Martin Weber studied myopic prospect theory vs. loss aversion
- Arkes and Blumer discussed the psychology of sunk costs, showing that people are more likely to attend events they have paid for, even if they dislike them

**The Disposition Effect in Investing**
- Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman introduced the concept of the disposition effect in investing
- Terrance Odean found that investors tend to sell winning stocks too early and hold losing stocks longer
- Sophisticated investors are less susceptible to the disposition effect.

**Regret Regulation:**
- Marcel Zeelenberg and Rik Pieters (2007)
- "A Theory of Regret Regulation 1.0"
- Comparison of event to personal norm or norm of other people leads to different counterfactuals, causal attributions, and emotions: regret or blame

**Habitually Taking Unreasonable Risks:**
- Inspired by example from legal philosophers Hart and Honoré (1985)
  - Woman married to a man with stomach ulcer identifies eating parsnips as cause of indigestion
  - Doctor identifies ulcerated condition as cause and meal as mere occasion
- Unusual events call for causal explanations and evoke counterfactual thoughts, closely related

**Counterfactual Thinking:**
- Applies to regret and elation following action and inaction (Landman, 1987; Gleicher et al., 1990)
- Actions that deviate from default produce blame and regret (Miller & Taylor, 1995)
- Counterfactual thinking plays a role in purchase decisions: brand names over generics (Simonson, 1992)
- Institutional trading and turn-of-the-year effect (Ng & Wang, 2004)

#### Choices, Frames, and Decision-Making Biases in Economics

**Influencing Factors in Decision Making:**
* **Evaluability of Attributes**: Hsee (1981) discusses how the formulation or framing of decisions can unjustifiably influence choices. This effect is known as "framing."
* **Cash vs. Credit Payments**: Thaler (1980) explains that payment methods, such as cash versus credit, can also affect consumer decisions.
* **Mortality Rates**: McNeil et al. (1982) demonstrate how fear plays a role in eliciting preferences for alternative therapies based on mortality rates.
* **Default Options**: Johnson and Goldstein (2003) discuss how default options, like organ donation, can impact decisions significantly.

**Two Selves Theory:**
* Daniel Kahneman's theory: The existence of two selves - one that makes decisions based on rational thinking and another that experiences emotions (Kahneman et al., 1978).
* Experienced utility vs objective happiness: A moment-based approach to understanding the difference between experienced utility and objective happiness (Kahneman, Wakker, & Sarin, 1997; Kahneman & Tversky, 1984).
* The role of a physician in decision making: Redelmeier and Kahneman (1996) highlight the impact of emotions on patients' memories and choices regarding medical treatments.
* Free to choose: Kahneman et al. (1993) explain that individuals may prefer more pain at any moment if they believe it will result in a better outcome overall.

**Neural Computation of Utility:**
* Shizgal (1999) explores the neural computation of utility through brain stimulation reward studies.
* Burst of stimulation: The duration and abruptness of drive reduction can influence the neural computation of utility.

#### Measuring Subjective Well-Being: Methods and Applications

**Studies on Life Satisfaction**

**Paul Rozin and Jennifer Stellar (2009)**
- Findings: People's overall life satisfaction is not significantly affected by the length of unhappy periods in their lives.
- Experiments tested for peak-end rule in unhappy lives: No significant difference found between living miserably for 60 years vs. 30 years or adding mildly miserable years before death.

**Questioning Life Satisfaction (2001)**
- Question used frequently: "Taken all together, how would you say things are these days? Would you say that you are very happy, pretty happy, or not too happy?"
- Included in General Social Survey in the US, correlations with other variables suggest a mix of satisfaction and experienced happiness.

**Cantril Self-Anchoring Striving Scale (Ladder Scale)**
- Respondents rate their current life on a ladder scale: 0 = "the worst possible life for you", 10 = "the best possible life for you".
- People have a common standard for what a good life is, accounted for the extraordinarily high correlation (r=.84) between GDP of countries and average ladder scores of their citizens.

**Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMAC)**
- Method: Individuals provide real-time reports of their emotions, behaviors, and environments using various data sources such as heart rate, blood pressure, or saliva samples.
- Applications: Ecological Momentary Assessment Well-Being by Arthur A. Stone, Saul S. Shiffman, and Marten W. DeVries (2008).

**Experienced Well-Being: Daily Life Evaluation**

#### "Factors Influencing Life Satisfaction: Finances, Geography, and Cars"

**Findings from Bowen and Bok's Research**
- Some findings reported by Carol Nickerson, Norbert Schwarz, and Ed Diener in "Financial Aspirations, Financial Success, and Overall Life Satisfaction: Who? and How?" Journal of Happiness Studies 8 (2007)
  - **Being very well-off financially**: Alexander Astin, M. R. King, and G. T. Richardson, "The American Freshman: National Norms for Fall 1976," Cooperative Institutional Research Program of the American Council on Education and the University of California at Los Angeles, Graduate School of Education, Laboratory for Research in Higher Education (1976)
    - **Money was not important**: Results presented in a talk at the American Economic Association annual meeting in 2004
      * Daniel Kahneman, "Puzzles of Well-Being," paper presented at the meeting
  - **Happiness of Californians** vs. Midwesterners: Relevant to policy response to climate change
    - Asian students reported lower life satisfaction but identical happiness levels when accounting for their overrepresentation in California compared to Midwest

**Clarification on Happiness and Life Satisfaction**

**Irrationality in Decision Making:**
- Dan Ariely's view on the mind in "Predictably Irrational" is not significantly different from the author's perspective, but they differ in term usage.

#### "Understanding Cognitive Biases in Decision Making"

**Becker and Murphy's "A Theory of Rational Addiction" (1988):**
- Becker and Murphy argued that individuals may make irrational choices due to addiction
- They proposed a theory based on the concept of **addiction capital**
- This theory explains how the value of future consumption is discounted in favor of immediate gratification, leading to addictive behaviors

**Thaler and Sunstein's "Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness" (2008):**
- Thaler and Sunstein discussed the concept of **nudging** - influencing people's decisions without limiting their freedom of choice
- They argued that small changes in the way information is presented can have significant effects on people's choices

**Gawande's "The Checklist Manifesto: How to Get Things Right" (2009):**
- Gawande emphasized the importance of **checklists** to improve decision making and reduce errors
- He argued that even experts can miss critical steps in complex processes, and checklists can help mitigate this

**Distinctive Vocabulary:**
- Heath, Larrick, and Klayman discussed how organizations can use **cognitive repairs** to compensate for individual shortcomings
- They proposed that well-designed processes and tools can help people make better decisions despite their cognitive biases

**Causality and Decision Making:**
- Ajzen, Alarcon, and others have studied various factors influencing decision making, including:
  - **Airplane crashes**: Anomalies in decision making that can lead to tragic consequences
  - **Ambiguity**: Suppression of ambiguous information can lead to poor decisions
  - **Anchoring index**: The influence of initial estimates on subsequent judgments
  - **Anchors**: Power of random numbers as cognitive anchors
  - **System 1 and System 2**: Dual-process theory of rationality, with different mechanisms for intuitive and analytical thinking
  - **WYSIATI (what you see is all there is)**: The bias to focus only on available information instead of considering alternatives

**Associative Coherence:**
- Kahneman, Lovallo, and Sibony discussed the concept of **associative coherence**, where activated ideas influence subsequent judgments
  - This can lead to biases like the **halo effect** (positive associations influencing judgments) and **plausibility** (making up credible explanations even when incorrect)
- This phenomenon is related to **cognitive dissonance**, where conflicting beliefs or experiences create psychological discomfort

**Anomalies in Decision Making:**
- Various experiments, like the **Ajzen Scare Algorithms**, **Asian Disease Problem**, and **Cab Driver Problem**, have highlighted anomalies in decision making:
  - These experimental designs highlight how small changes in problem framing or available information can lead to large differences in judgments

**Affective Forecasting:**
- Kahneman and Fredrickson studied the accuracy of affective forecasting, or predictions about future emotional states
  - They found that people tend to overestimate the persistence of positive emotions from past experiences and underestimate negative emotions

**Other Key Concepts:**
- **Apgar Scores**: A measure of neonatal health assessment
- **Anonymity**: In experiments, participants often make more honest judgments when their identity is protected
- **Hostility to Anesthesiologists**: Experiments show that people may have negative biases against certain professions (e.g., anesthesiologists) based on stereotypes
- **Multiple Regression**: A statistical method for understanding the relationships between variables
